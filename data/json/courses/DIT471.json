    "Confirmation": "This course syllabus was confirmed by Department of Computer Science and\nEngineering on 2020-11-11 and was last revised on 2023-11-14 to be valid from 2024-09-\n02, autumn semester of 2024.",
    "Position in the educational system": "The course can be part of the following programmes: 1) Mathematical Sciences,\nMaster's Programme (N2MAT), 2) Computer Science, Master's Programme (N2COS)\nand 3) Applied Data Science Master's Programme (N2ADS)\n\nMain field of studies\nComputer Science\nData Science\n\nSpecialization\nA1F, Second cycle, has second-cycle\ncourse/s as entry requirements\nA1F, Second cycle, has second-cycle\ncourse/s as entry requirements",
    "Entry requirements": "To be eligible for the course the student must have successfully completed courses in:\n• 7.5 credits of programming (Python experience desirable but not absolutely\nrequired)\n• 7.5 credits of a data structures or basic algorithm course, or the course DIT374\n• 7.5 credits of basic probability and statistics\n• 7.5 credits of calculus\n• 7.5 credits of linear algebra\n• 7.5 credits of a standard basic course in machine learning (for example DIT381,\nMSA220 or DIT866)\nApplicants must prove knowledge of English: English 6/English B or the equivalent level\nof an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.",
    "Learning outcomes": "On successful completion of the course the student will be able to:\n• to learn about modern and advanced machine learning methods and analyze them\nin different situations\n• to read and understand state-of-the-art scientific articles in the field\n• to propose and employ suitable models for the complex machine learning tasks\n• to be prepared for research and development of advanced machine learning\nmethods\n\nKnowledge and understanding\n• to understand in depth the advanced machine learning methods, and learn their\npractical implications\n• to understand some of the main research areas and topics within machine learning\n• to learn the way the complex real problems are turned into research questions in\nmachine learning\n\nCompetence and skills\n• to analyze advanced machine learning and understand why a method may work or\nmay fail\n• to deal with the cases where the standard machine learning is not very helpful and\nneeds to be improved\n• to be better prepared for research in AI/machine learning\n• to read and follow the relevant state-of-the-art research articles\n\nJudgement and approach\n• to employ a suitable model w.r.t. the assumptions and analyze the different aspects\nsuch as performance and effectiveness\n• to learn how machine learning models can be further developed to satisfy the\nrequirements\n• to distinguish some of the main research areas in machine learning, the\ncorresponding challenges and the current approaches to solve them",
    "Course content": "The course is focused on advanced theory, methods and mathematics of machine\nlearning.\n\nThe course content is the following:\n• Theoretical machine learning and the computational aspects\n• Sequential decision making\n• Online learning/Active learning/Multi-armed bandits\n• Markov decision processes\n• Reinforcement learning\n• Relevant advanced deep learning (Deep Neural Network) models",
    "Sub-courses": "1. Written hall examination (Skriftlig salstentamen), 4 credits\nGrading scale: Pass with distinction (5), Pass with credit (4), Pass (3) and Fail (U)\n2. Assignments (Inlämningsuppgifter), 3.5 credits\nGrading scale: Pass with distinction (5), Pass with credit (4), Pass (3) and Fail (U)",
    "Form of teaching": "Lectures and assignments\n\nLanguage of instruction: English",
    "Assessment": "The course is examined by assignments and a written hall examination.\n\nIf a student, who has failed the same examined element on two occasions, wishes to\nchange examiner before the next examination session, such a request is to be submitted\nto the department in writing and granted unless there are special reasons to the contrary\n(Chapter 6, Section 22 of Higher Education Ordinance).\n\nIn the event that a course has ceased or undergone major changes, students are to be\nguaranteed at least three examination sessions (including the ordinary examination\nsession) over a period of at least one year, though at most two years after the course has\nceased/been changed. The same applies to work experience and VFU, although this is\nrestricted to just one additional examination session.",
    "Grades": "The grading scale comprises: Pass with distinction (5), Pass with credit (4), Pass (3) and\nFail (U).\nTo pass the course, all mandatory components must be passed. To earn a higher grade\nthan 3, a higher weighted average from the grades of the components is required.",
    "Course evaluation": "The course is evaluated through meeting after the course between teachers and student\nrepresentatives. Further, an anonymous questionnaire is used to ensure written\ninformation. The outcome of the evaluations serves to improve the course by indicating\nwhich parts could be added, improved, changed or removed.\n\nThe results of and possible changes to the course will be shared with students who\nparticipated in the evaluation and students who are starting the course.",
    "Additional information": "The course is a joint course together with Chalmers.\nCourse literature will be announced at the latest 8 weeks prior to the start of the course.\nThe course replaces the course DIT470, 7.5 credits. The course cannot be included in a\ndegree which contains DIT470. Neither can the course be included in a degree which is\nbased on another degree in which the course DIT470 is included."
