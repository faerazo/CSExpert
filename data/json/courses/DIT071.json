    "Confirmation": "This course syllabus was confirmed by The IT Faculty Board on 2006-11-17 and was\nlast revised on 2017-06-07 by Department of Computer Science and Engineering to be\nvalid from 2017-08-20, autumn semester of 2017.",
    "Position in the educational system": "The course is a part of the Computer Science Master's Programme and is also an elective\ncourse at the University of Gothenburg.\nThe course can be part of the following programmes: 1) Computer Science, Master's\nProgramme (N2COS), 2) Applied Data Science Master's Programme (N2ADS), 3)\nComputer Science, Bachelor's Programme (N1COS) and 4) No translation available\n(NDATM)",
    "Entry requirements": "The requirement for the course is to have successfully completed two years studies\nwithin the subject Computer Science or equivalent.\nSpecifically, the course DIT420 Computer Communication or equivalent is required. A\ncourse in Computer security such as DIT641 is recommended but not required.\nApplicants must prove knowledge of English: English 6/English B or the equivalent level\nof an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.",
    "Learning outcomes": "After cmpletion of the course the student should be able to :\n5.1 Knowledge and understanding\n• Describe and state how applications can communicate securely and what possible\ntools and protocols exist in order to offer different levels of security\n• Show knowledge about how to evaluate new protocols and the level of security they\nmay offer\n• Show skills to draw own conclusions and understand what makes systems\nvulnerable and be able to predict new attack methods before they become a reality\n• Describe what impact the selection of different protocols and security architectures\ncan have to an application or to a system.\n5.2 Skills and abilities\n• Critically analyze and design secure networks, applications and systems\n• Show skills to evaluate the security needs for networked systems and applications\n• Obtained skills to be able to communicate efficiently with professionals working in\nthe field\n5.3 Judgment and approach\n• Judge what is required by a sound security architecture\n• Describe and formulate how to evaluate the security needs for networked systems\nand applications",
    "Course content": "The course begins by looking at weaknesses that have plagued networked systems for\nyears. The course also contains countermeasures like firewalls and security protocols\nsuch as SSL, SSH and IPsec and investigate in detail what makes them secure. The\ncourse also gives a survey of cryptographic tools and explains how they can be utilized\nin protocols and applications, for example how to provide secure user authentication\nover a public network.\nKnowledge about possible threats and countermeasures is important not only for the\nnetwork security specialist but also for application programmers and everyone else who\nwants to understand what level of security a system and an application can offer. By\nknowing the problems, future systems can be designed to be much more secure and\nreliable than today.\nThe course covers many topics related to communications and network security:\n• Network attacks, encryption and random number generation\n• Analysis of weaknesses and attacks against common protocols such as TCP, UDP,\nIP, and ICMP. Denial of service (DOS) attacks. Scanning and operating system\nfingerprinting.\n• Access control, authentication mechanisms, passwords, Radius, AAA, PKI, key\ndistribution, Kerberos\n• Identity management, certificates, X.509, revocation, smart cards, LDAP, OCSP\n•\nSecurity protocols such as IPSec, SSL and SSH\n• Security in wireless networks, WEP, WPA, IEEE 802.1x, EAP, TKIP\n• Network design, firewalls, packet filters, proxies, NAT, tunnelling, ingress and\negress filtering\n• Virtual private networks (VPN), tunnelling protocols, segmentation and remote\naccess\n• Logs, alarms, syslog, SNMP\n• Link level security, VLAN technology, security in ARP, DHCP and DNS.\nThe course consists of a series of lectures and laborative exercises. The laborative\nexercises focus on network scanning, building firewalls and study of common security\nprotocols such as SSL.",
    "Sub-courses": "1. Laboratory work (Laboration), 1.5 higher education credits\nGrading scale: Pass (G) and Fail (U)\n2. Written exam (Tentamen), 6 higher education credits\nGrading scale: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U)",
    "Form of teaching": "The course consists of a series of lectures and laborative exercises. The laborative\nexercises focus on network scanning, building firewalls and study of common security\nprotocols such as SSL.\nLanguage of instruction: English",
    "Assessment": "An individual written exam given in an examination hall. Four laboratory exercises,\ncarried out in pairs in the departments laboratory.\nA student who has failed the same examination twice has the right to request of the\ndepartment a change of examiner. The request is to be in writing and submitted as soon\nas possible. The department is to grant such a request withour undue delay.\nIn cases where a course has been discontinued or major changes have been made a\nstudent should be guaranteed at least three examination occasions (including the\nordinary examination occasion) during a time of at least one year from the last time the\ncourse was given.",
    "Grades": "The grading scale comprises: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U).\nTo pass the course the student must pass both the laboratory exercises and the written\nexam.\nThe score on the final exam determines whether a Pass with Distinction for the course is\nawarded. In order to be granted VG, the candidate must have at least 80% of the total\nnumber of credit points at the exam. In order to be granted G, the candidate must have\nat least 50% of the total number of credit points at the exam.",
    "Course evaluation": "The course is evaluated through meetings both during and after the course between\nteachers and student representatives. Further, an anonymous questionnaire is used to\nensure written information. The outcome of the evaluations serves to improve the\ncourse by indicating which parts could be added, improved, changed or removed.",
