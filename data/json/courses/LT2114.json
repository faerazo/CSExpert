    "Confirmation": "This course syllabus was confirmed by Department of Philosophy, Linguistics and\nTheory of Science on 2017-06-01 and was last revised on 2019-03-14 to be valid from\n2019-03-18, spring semester of 2019.",
    "Position in the educational system": "Can also be offered as a freestanding course.\nThe course can be part of the following programmes: 1) Computer Science, Master's\nProgramme (N2COS) and 2) Applied Data Science Master's Programme (N2ADS)",
    "Entry requirements": "For admission to course is required at least 7.5 credits in programming such as DIT948\nProgramming, DIT012 Imperative programming with basic object orientation, DIT142\nFunctional programming, LT2001 Introduction to programming, or the equivalent.",
    "Learning outcomes": "On successful completion of the course the student will be able to:\nKnowledge and understanding\n• account for basic concepts in language technology,\n• explain in detail some common algorithms for language technology assignments\nsuch as text categorisation or part-of-speech tagging,\n• account for different evaluation methods in language technology as well as when\nthey are applicable.\nCompetence and skills\n• use a language technology software library to develop practical data driven language\ntechnology applications,\n• implement methods for basic text processing,\n• implement evaluation procedures for language technology assignments.\nJudgement and approach\n• discuss which language technology method is applicable to solve a specific language\ntechnology problem,\n• make an informed assessment on how to solve an NLP task.",
    "Course content": "The course gives a practical introduction to different problems encountered within\nnatural language processing and some standard solutions. Students will gain practical\nexperience in programming while solving these problems. The course is divided into four\nmain topics, one covering basic concepts and three covering subfields of natural\nlanguage processing: basic text processing, syntactic and morphological analysis, as well\nas semantics and pragmatics. The final selection of the subjects covered in the four\nsubfields is decided by the course coordinator before the start of the course. The\nfollowing is an example of subjects that can be completed during the course:\n1. Basic concepts:\n• basic concepts in language technology,\n• probability theory and machine learning for language technology problems,\n• common evaluation measurement, e.g. correctness, precision and recall.\n2. Basic text processing:\n• corpora and corpus annotation,\n• basic statistical corpus analysis.\n3. Syntax and morphology:\n• morphological analysis (part-of-speech analysis) with machine learning and finite-\nstate technology,\n• syntactic analysis by means of rule-based and data-driven methods.\n4. semantics and pragmatics:\n• word sense disambiguation with machine learning,\n• text classification or topic modeling with machine learning.",
    "Sub-courses": "1. Written examination (Written examination), 4 credits\nGrading scale: Pass with distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U)\n2. Assignments, 3.5 credits\nGrading scale: Pass with distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U)",
    "Form of teaching": "Lectures, exercises, computer exercises. There are mandatory laboratory exercises that\nrequire attendance for a passing grade.\nLanguage of instruction: English",
    "Assessment": "The course is assessed with a combination of written examination, written assignments,\nlab sessions and active participation while making exercises and attending laboratory\nsessions.\nWhen a student, who has failed the same examined component twice, wishes to change\nexaminer before the next examination, a written application shall be sent to the\ndepartment responsible for the course and shall be granted unless there are special\nreasons to the contrary (Chapter 6, Section 22 of Higher Education Ordinance).\nIn the case where a course has been discontinued or has undergone major changes, the\nstudent shall normally be guaranteed at least three examination sessions (including the\nregular examination session) during a period of at least one year on the basis of the\ncourse's former structure.",
    "Grades": "The grading scale comprises: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U).\nFor the grade Pass is required:\n• passed written examination\n• completed written assignments\n• active attendance at labs\nTo pass with distinction is required:\n• written examination passed with distinction\n• completed written assignments of high quality\n• active attendance at labs",
    "Course evaluation": "The director of studies or the equivalent is responsible to ensure that a short version of\nthe students course evaluation is done, published and taken into account when\ndeveloping/improving the course.\nThe result and any changes in the course structure must be communicated to both the\nstudents who completed the evaluation and to the students who will start the course.",
