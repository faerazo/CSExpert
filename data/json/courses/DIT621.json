    "Confirmation": "This course syllabus was confirmed by Department of Computer Science and\nEngineering on 2012-11-12 and was last revised on 2019-10-28 to be valid from 2020-08-\n31, autumn semester of 2020.",
    "Position in the educational system": "The course is offered within several programmes. It is also a single subject course at the\nUniversity of Gothenburg.\nThe course can be part of the following programmes: 1) Computer Science, Master's\nProgramme (N2COS), 2) Mathematical Sciences, Master's Programme (N2MAT), 3)\nApplied Data Science Master's Programme (N2ADS), 4) Bachelor's Programme in\nMathematics (N1MAT) and 5) Computer Science, Bachelor's Programme (N1COS)",
    "Entry requirements": "To be eligible for the course the student must have successfully completed university\nlevel courses of at least 45 credits, including:\n•\n• at least 15 credits in programming, e.g., DIT440, DIT012, DIT953, or equivalent,\nat least 7.5 credits in mathematics or mathematic reasoning, e.g., DIT980, DIT855,\nor equivalent,\n• concepts in logic, sets, functions and relations that could be acquired with, e.g.,\nDIT980, DIT851, or equivalent.",
    "Learning outcomes": "On successful completion of the course the student will be able to:\nKnowledge and understanding\n• explain the semantic meaning of queries using relational algebra\n• describe the effects of transactions and indexes in a relational database\nCompetence and skills\n•\n• construct an Entity-Relationship diagram for a given domain\n• translate an Entity-Relationship diagram into a relational database schema\napply design theory concepts for relational databases such as functional\ndependencies and normalization\n• retrieve and modify data using a database language for respective task\n•\ndesign a database interface using constraints, views, triggers and privileges\n• implement a relational database schema and related interface using a data definition\nlanguage\n• communicate with a database, through a database interface, from a software\napplication\nJudgement and approach\n• evaluate and create different models for a database domain using Entity-\nRelationship diagrams and relational schemas\n• contrast different data models, such as the relational and the semi-structured data\nmodels",
    "Course content": "The course covers the basic principles of database systems as seen by users, application\nprogrammers and database administrators. A laboratory assignment develops these\ntopics as a running example throughout the course. These include programming in SQL,\nas seen by a user querying or modifying an existing database, by a database designer,\nand by an application programmer invoking SQL from a host language.\nCourse contents include:\n• entity-relationship modeling\n• functional dependencies and normalisation\n• database querying and manipulation through SQL\n• interfacing to a database from a host language (such as Java/JDBC)\n• overview of non-SQL models (such as JSON or XML)",
    "Sub-courses": "1. Written hall examination ( Skriftlig salstentamen ), 4.5 credits\nGrading scale: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U)\n2. Laboratory work (Laboration), 3 credits\nGrading scale: Pass (G) and Fail (U)",
    "Form of teaching": "The course consists of weekly lectures and exercise sessions, as well as supervised lab\nsessions.",
    "Assessment": "Written individual exam given in an examination hall and programming assignments.\nThe programming assignments are normally carried out in pairs.\nIf a student, who has failed the same examined component twice, wishes to change\nexaminer before the next examination, a written application shall be sent to the\ndepartment responsible for the course and shall be granted unless there are special\nreasons to the contrary (Chapter 6, Section 22 of Higher Education Ordinance).\nIn cases where a course has been discontinued or has undergone major changes, the\nstudent shall normally be guaranteed at least three examination occasions (including the\nordinary examination) during a period of at least one year from the last time the course\nwas given.",
    "Grades": "The grading scale comprises: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U).\nA Pass grade (G) for the entire course requires at least a Pass grade for all sub-courses.\nTo be awarded Pass with Distinction (VG) for a full course, the student must, in\naddition, receive the grade VG on the sub-course Written examination.",
    "Course evaluation": "The course is evaluated through meetings both during and after the course between\nteachers and student representatives. Further, an anonymous questionnaire is used to\nensure written information. The outcome of the evaluations serves to improve the\ncourse by indicating which parts could be added, improved, changed or removed.",
    "Additional information": "The course is a joint course together with Chalmers.\nCourse literature to be announced the latest 8 weeks prior to the start of the course.\nThe course replaces the course DIT620, 7.5 credits. The course cannot be included in a\ndegree which contains DIT620. Neither can the course be included in a degree which is\nbased on another degree in which the course DIT620 is included."
