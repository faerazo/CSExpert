    "Confirmation": "This course syllabus was confirmed by The IT Faculty Board on 2011-05-20 and was\nlast revised on 2016-02-09 by Department of Computer Science and Engineering to be\nvalid from 2017-01-16, spring semester of 2017.",
    "Position in the educational system": "The course is a part of the Computer Science Bachelor's programme and an elective\ncourse at the University of Gothenburg.\nThe course can be part of the following programmes: 1) Computer Science, Master's\nProgramme (N2COS) and 2) Computer Science, Bachelor's Programme (N1COS)",
    "Entry requirements": "The requirement for the course is to have successfully completed 100 hec in the\nComputer Science Bachelor's\nProgramme or equivalent. The following courses, or equivalent, must be completed:\nDIT012 Imperative Programming with Basic Object-orientation, 7.5 hec, DIT952\nObject-oriented Programming and Design 7.5 hec, DIT960 Data structures, 7.5 hec,\nDIT420 Computer communication 7.5 hec and DIT620 Databases 7.5 hec.",
    "Learning outcomes": "After completion of the course the student is expected to be able to:\nKnowledge and understanding\n- Design, implement, deploy, test and debug a basic web application.\n- Solve the special problems of web application in particular the use of multiple\nparadigms and technologies within the same application.\n- Explain and discuss the importance of open standards\nSkills and abilities\n- Search for relevant information based on specifications.\nJudgement and approach\n- Assess different potential solutions for the development of web applications.",
    "Course content": "The course presents a number of technologies, how they are related and used for\ndeveloping web applications. The course provides a good insight to modern complex\nweb based applications. Design problems related to web- applications are presented\nsuch as session handling, navigation, persistens, etc.\nInformation retrieval from manuals and specifications is an integral and important\naspect of the course.\nThe course is applied and the work is carried out in modern advanced development\nenvironments. As an important part the course presents advanced debugging,\nconfiguration, deployment and execution of web applications.",
    "Sub-courses": "1. Project (Projekt), 6 higher education credits\nGrading scale: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U)\n2. Assignments (Inl√§mningsuppgifter), 1.5 higher education credits\nGrading scale: Pass (G) and Fail (U)",
    "Form of teaching": "Lectures, computer exercises (assignments) and project work.",
    "Assessment": "The course is examined by individual written assignments and a written project. The\nproject is carried out in groups of normally 4 students.\nIf a student, who has failed the same examined component twice, wishes to change\nexaminer before the next examination, a written application shall be sent to the\ndepartment responsible for the course and shall be granted unless there are special\nreasons to the contrary (Chapter 6, Section 22 of Higher Education Ordinance).\nIn cases where a course has been discontinued or has undergone major changes, the\nstudent shall normally be guaranteed at least three examination occasions (including the\nordinary examination) during a period of at least one year from the last time the course\nwas given.",
