    "Confirmation": "This course syllabus was confirmed by The IT Faculty Board on 2010-12-21 and was\nlast revised on 2016-02-23 by Department of Applied Information Technology to be\nvalid from 2016-09-01, autumn semester of 2016.",
    "Position in the educational system": "The course can be offered as a single subject course.\nThe course can be part of the following programmes: 1) Computer Science, Master's\nProgramme (N2COS) and 2) Computer Science, Bachelor's Programme (N1COS)",
    "Entry requirements": "To be eligible for the course the student must have a Bachelor degree of 180 hec. Special\nrequirements are the course TIA108 Prototyping in Interaction Design 7.5 credits and a\ncourse in Human-Computer Interaction (TIG095) 7.5 credits or the equivalent.\nTo be eligible for this course as a programme student in the Computer Science\nBachelor's Programme, N1COS, the student must have passed at least 90 credits in\nprogramme courses and the addditional courses TIG095 Human Computer Interaction\n7.5 credits and TIA108 Prototyping in Interaction Design 7.5 credits or the equivalent.",
    "Learning outcomes": "After completion of this course, the student should be able to:\nKnowledge and understanding\n• Explain how computational technology can be used for design of interactive\nsystems,\n• Explain human cognition and motor skills,\n• Explain how human cognition and motor skills can guide the design and evaluation\nof tangible user interfaces,\n• Explain theories of tangible interaction.\nSkills and abilities\n• Design and realize interactive prototypes using tangible interface components,\n• Choose appropriate and economic use of advanced components and corresponding\ntechniques,\n• Reflect on the relation between spatiality, form, and temporality in tangible\ninteraction design.\nJudgement and approach\n• Criticize and discuss computer-based tangible artifacts,\n• Question in which way computational technology is shaping our present and future\nsociety and way of life,\n• Reflect on sustainability issues such as energy consumption and material waste\ncaused by novel computational systems and devices.",
    "Course content": "Tangible interaction is based on physical interfaces that are either specifically developed\nfor one system or for those that in new ways, allows interaction with computer systems.\nThe course puts the skills and knowledge acquired in the prototyping course into an\napplied context. Tangible interaction deals with computational technology and services\nand offers both theoretical and practical educational modalities. Lectures will present\ntheory and development of tangible interaction and draws from research and\ncommercial practice. Technologies such as sensors, actuators and smart materials are\npresented from a perspective of human interaction and use.",
    "Sub-courses": "",
    "Form of teaching": "Education is performed through lectures, workshops and a group project.\nLanguage of instruction: English",
    "Assessment": "The course is examined through two modules:\n1. Project 4 credits (U-VG) and\n2. Individual Written Home Essay 3.5 credits (U-VG)\nAssessment is based on a group project performed in the studios, as well as an individual\nhome essay.\nA student who has failed the examination twice has the right to change examiners, if it is\npossible. A written application should be sent to the Department.",
    "Grades": "The grading scale comprises: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U).\nTo receive a passing grade on the entire course, the student must have received a passing\ngrade on both the Project and the Individual Written Home Essay.\nTo receive Pass with Distinction on the entire course, the student must have received at\nleast the grade Pass on the Project and the grade Pass with Distinction on the Individual\nWritten Home Essay.",
    "Course evaluation": "After completion of the course the students are to be given the possibility of\nparticipating in course anonymously. Continuous evaluation will be used, including\nthree meetings between teacher(s) and student representatives. Additionally, the course\nwill be evaluated with a course questionnaire, and discussed with the student\nrepresentatives.",
