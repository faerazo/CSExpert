    "Confirmation": "This course syllabus was confirmed by Department of Computer Science and Engineering on 2021-11-01 to be valid from 2022-08-29, autumn semester of 2022.",
    "Position in the educational system": "The course can be part of the following programmes: 1) Computer Science, Master's Programme (N2COS), 2) Mathematical Sciences, Master's Programme (N2MAT) and 3) Applied Data Science Master's Programme (N2ADS)\nMain field of studies Specialization\nComputer Science A1N, Second cycle, has only first-cycle course/s as entry requirements\nData Science A1N, Second cycle, has only first-cycle course/s as entry requirements",
    "Entry requirements": "To be eligible to the course, the student should have a bachelor degree.\nIn particular, the student must have acquired the following knowledge:\n• 7.5 credits of programming (e.g., DIT440 Introduction to Functional Programming, DIT042 Object-Oriented Programming, DIT012 Imperative Programming with Basic Object-Orientation, or equivalent)\n• 7.5 credits of basic probability and statistics (e.g., MSG810 Mathematical Statistics and Discrete Mathematics, DIT861 Statistical Methods for Data Science, or equivalent)\n• 7.5 credits of linear algebra (e.g., MMGD20 Linear Algebra, or equivalent)\n• 7.5 credits of calculus (e.g., MMGD30 Calculus, or equivalent)\nApplicants must prove knowledge of English: English 6/English B or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.",
    "Learning outcomes": "On successful completion of the course the student will be able to:\nKnowledge and understanding\n• Provide an overview over different frameworks for causality and causal inference\n• Describe important causal problems and give examples of their applications\n• Explain how problems of causal inference differ from other types of (statistical) inference problems\n• Account for common approaches to causal inference and the conditions under which they are accurate\nCompetence and skills\n• Identify different types of causal inference problems in real-world applications\n• Analyze causal inference problems and decide using mathematical frameworks the plausibility of solving them under certain conditions\n• Implement and apply methods for causal inference appropriate for specific problems\nJudgement and approach\n• Discuss pros and cons of different frameworks for causality and causal inference\n• Account for fundamental limitations in the possibility of causal identification\n• Critically analyse and discuss research and applications of causal inference, in particular with respect to adjustment for confounding factors",
    "Course content": "The purpose of this course is to give knowledge and understanding of causality-the science of cause and effect—and causal inference from a mathematical, statistical and computational perspective. It should also provide the tools necessary for solving causal inference problems in practical applications.\nThe content is structured into several modules, one for each week of the course. It begins by briefly covering necessary prerequisites, such as probabilistic graphical models, and by introducing structural definitions of causality. This will enable the study of sufficient conditions for inferring causal relationships between random variables. The second half of the course covers estimation of causal effects and policy evaluation. These are important topics in, e.g., epidemiology. At the end of the course, each student will present a research paper on a topic of their choice.\nThe course covers, among other things:\n• Probabilistic graphical models\n• Causality\n• Structural causal models (SCM)\n• Causal structure learning\n• Neyman-Rubin causal model (potential outcomes)\n• Observational studies\n• Policy evaluation\n• Mediation analysis",
    "Sub-courses": "1. Assignments (Inlämningsuppgifter), 7.5 credits\nGrading scale: Pass with distinction (5), Pass with credit (4), Pass (3) and Fail (U)",
    "Form of teaching": "Modules composed of lectures, follow-up sessions and hand-in assignments. Follow-up sessions are interactive meetings focused on problem solving and advanced aspects of the module topic. The course concludes with research paper presentations by students.\nLanguage of instruction: English",
    "Assessment": "Assignments and paper presentations are graded individually.\nA student who has taken two exams in a course or part of a course without obtaining a pass grade is entitled to the nomination of another examiner. The student needs to contact the department for a new examiner, preferably in writing, and this should be approved by the department unless there are special reasons to the contrary (Chapter 6 Section 22 of the Higher Education Ordinance).\nIf a student has received a recommendation from the University of Gothenburg for special educational support, where it is compatible with the learning outcomes of the course and provided that no unreasonable resources are required, the examiner may decide to allow the student to sit an adjusted exam or alternative form of assessment.\nIn the event that a course has ceased or undergone major changes, students are to be guaranteed at least three examination sessions (including the ordinary examination session) over a period of at least one year, but no more than two years, after the course has ceased/been changed. The same applies to placements and professional placements (VFU), although this is restricted to just one additional examination session.",
    "Grades": "The grading scale comprises: Pass with distinction (5), Pass with credit (4), Pass (3) and Fail (U).\nTo pass the course, all mandatory components must be passed. To earn a higher grade than Pass, a higher weighted average from the grades of the components is required.",
    "Course evaluation": "The course is evaluated through meetings both during and after the course between teachers and student representatives. Further, an anonymous questionnaire is used to ensure written information. The outcome of the evaluations serves to improve the course by indication which parts could be added, improved, changed or removed.",
    "Additional information": "The course is a joint course together with Chalmers.\nCourse literature will be announced at least 8 weeks prior to the start of the course.\nWe strongly recommend that the student has taken a course in Machine learning, for example DIT381 or similar, or that such a course is taken in parallel alongside this course."
