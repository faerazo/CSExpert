    "Confirmation": "This course syllabus was confirmed by Department of Computer Science and Engineering on 2019-12-04 to be valid from 2021-01-18, spring semester of 2021.",
    "Position in the educational system": "The course can be part of the following programmes: 1) Computer Science, Master's Programme (N2COS), 2) Mathematical Sciences, Master's Programme (N2MAT) and 3) Applied Data Science Master's Programme (N2ADS)\n\nMain field of studies\nComputer Science\nData Science\n\nSpecialization\nA1F, Second cycle, has second-cycle course/s as entry requirements\nA1F, Second cycle, has second-cycle course/s as entry requirements",
    "Entry requirements": "To be eligible for the course the student must have successfully completed courses in:\n• 7.5 credits of programming (Python experience desirable but not absolutely\nrequired)\n• 7.5 credits of a data structures or basic algorithm course\n• 7.5 credits of basic probability and statistics\n• 7.5 credits of calculus\n• 7.5 credits of linear algebra\n• 7.5 credits of a standard basic course in machine learning (for example DIT381,\nMSA220 or DIT866)",
    "Learning outcomes": "On successful completion of the course the student will be able to:\n• to learn about modern and advanced machine learning methods and analyze them in\ndifferent situations\n• to read and understand state-of-the-art scientific articles in the field\n• to propose and employ suitable models for the complex machine learning tasks\n• to be prepared for research and development of advanced machine learning methods\n\nKnowledge and understanding\n• to understand in depth the advanced machine learning methods, and learn their\npractical implications\n• to understand some of the main research areas and topics within machine learning\n• to learn the way the complex real problems are turned into research questions in\nmachine learning\n\nCompetence and skills\n• to analyze advanced machine learning and understand why a method may work or\nmay fail\n• to deal with the cases where the standard machine learning is not very helpful and\nneeds to be improved\n• to be better prepared for research in AI/machine learning\n• to read and follow the relevant state-of-the-art research articles\n\nJudgement and approach\n• to employ a suitable model w.r.t. the assumptions and analyze the different aspects\nsuch as performance and effectiveness\n• to learn how machine learning models can be further developed to satisfy the\nrequirements\n• to distinguish some of the main research areas in machine learning, the\ncorresponding challenges and the current approaches to solve them",
    "Course content": "• Theoretical machine learning and the computational aspects\n• Advanced deep learning (Deep Neural Network) models\n• Active learning/Online learning\n• Advanced unsupervised learning, for example, GANs, clustering and dimension\nreduction",
    "Sub-courses": "1. Written hall examination (Skriftlig salstentamen), 4 credits\nGrading scale: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U)\n2. Assignments (Inlämningsuppgifter), 3.5 credits\nGrading scale: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U)",
    "Form of teaching": "Lectures and assignments\n\nLanguage of instruction: English",
    "Assessment": "The course will be examined by an written hall examination and the assignments.\n\nIf a student, who has failed the same examined element on two occasions, wishes to\nchange examiner before the next examination session, such a request is to be submitted\nto the department in writing and granted unless there are special reasons to the contrary\n(Chapter 6, Section 22 of Higher Education Ordinance).\n\nIn the event that a course has ceased or undergone major changes, students are to be\nguaranteed at least three examination sessions (including the ordinary examination\nsession) over a period of at least one year, though at most two years after the course has\nceased/been changed. The same applies to work experience and VFU, although this is\nrestricted to just one additional examination session.",
    "Grades": "The grading scale comprises: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U).\nA passing grade for the entire course requires at least a passing grade for all sub-courses.\nTo be awarded a higer passing grade for a full course, the student must, in addition,\nhave a higher average on the weighted grades on the sub-courses grades.",
    "Course evaluation": "The course is evaluated through meeting after the course between teachers and student\nrepresentatives. Further, an anonymous questionnaire is used to ensure written\ninformation. The outcome of the evaluations serves to improve the course by indicating\nwhich parts could be added, improved, changed or removed.\nThe results of and possible changes to the course will be shared with students who\nparticipated in the evaluation and students who are starting the course.",
    "Additional information": "The course is a joint course together with Chalmers.\nCourse literature will be announced at the latest 8 weeks prior to the start of the course."
