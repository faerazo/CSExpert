    "Position in the educational system": "The course can be part of the following programmes: 1) Applied Data Science Master's Programme (N2ADS) and 2) Master in Language Technology (One year or Two years) (H2MLT)",
    "Entry requirements": "Passed courses\n• LT2306 Machine learning, 7.5 hecr,\n• LT2203 Computational semantics, 7.5 hecr, and\n• LT2201 Speech Technology, 7.5 hecr\nor equivalent language technology skills and knowledge.",
    "Learning outcomes": "Knowledge and understanding\n• Learn how linguistic meaning interacts with the world around us and how it is coordinated between and learned by agents.\n• Learn about the basic concepts involved in situated language processing: perceptual judgements, grounding, situated dialogue, perceptual representation of space, linguistic representation of space, embodiment\n• Learn about the techniques of situated language interpretation and generation\n• Become familiar with the most widely known implementations of embodied situated dialogue systems.\n• Learn about the resources available for situated language processing.\nSkills and abilities\n• Acquire theoretical pre-requisite knowledge to be able to build parts of situated dialogue agents.\nJudgement and approach\n• Make an informed choice of different techniques for situated natural language interpre- tation and generation.",
    "Course content": "The course gives a survey of theory and practical computational implementations of how natural language interacts with the physical world. We will look at topics such as semantic theories of human language, action and perception, situated dialogue, situated language acquisition, grounding of language in action and perception, spatial cognition, generation and interpretation of scene descriptions from images and videos, integrated robotic dialogue systems and others.",

    "Form of teaching": "The course will be organised as a series of lectures where some lectures will be supplemented by seminar-style student presentations of a pre-selected papers/book chapters.",
    "Assessment": "The examination consists of a combination of active participation at seminars, seminar presentation, and either a course paper or a well documented implementation.\nA student who has failed an examination twice has the right to change examiners if it is feasible. A written application should be sent to the board of the department.",
