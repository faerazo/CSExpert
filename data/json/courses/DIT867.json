    "Confirmation": "This course syllabus was confirmed by Department of Computer Science and\nEngineering on 2020-12-18 to be valid from 2022-01-17, spring semester of 2022.",
    "Position in the educational system": "The course is compulsory within the Applied Data Science Master's Programme. It is\nalso a single subject course at the University of Gothenburg.\nThe course can be part of the following programmes: 1) Computer Science, Master's\nProgramme (N2COS), 2) Mathematical Sciences, Master's Programme (N2MAT), 3)\nApplied Data Science Master's Programme (N2ADS), 4) Computer Science, Bachelor's\nProgramme (N1COS) and 5) Software Engineering and Management Master's\nProgramme (N2SOF)",
    "Entry requirements": "To be eligible to the course, the student should have a Bachelor's degree in any subject,\nor have successfully completed 90 credits of studies in computer science, software\nengineering, or equivalent. Specifically, the course requires\n• 7.5 credits programming,\n• 7.5 credits introduction to data science or AI, such as DIT852 or DIT405,\n• 7.5 credits calculus or mathematical modeling (such as DIT856),\n• 7.5 credits probability theory, statistics, or mathematical statistics, such as DIT862.\nAlternatively have taken both of the following two courses: DIT847 and DIT278 (or\nequivalent)\nApplicants must prove knowledge of English: English 6/English B or the equivalent level\nof an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.",
    "Learning outcomes": "After completion of the course the student should be able to:\nKnowledge and understanding\n• describe the most common types of machine learning problems,\n• explain what types of problems can be addressed by machine learning, and the\nlimitations of machine learning\n• account for why it is important to have informative data and features for the success\nof machine learning systems,\n• explain on a high level how different machine learning models generalize from\ntraining examples.\nCompetence and skills\n• apply a machine learning toolkit in an application relevant to the data science area,\n• write the code to implement some machine learning algorithms,\n• apply evaluation methods to assess the quality of a machine learning system, and\ncompare different machine learning systems.\nJudgement and approach\n• discuss the advantages and limitations of different machine learning models with\nrespect to a given task,\n• reason about what type of information or features could be useful in a machine\nlearning task,\n• select the appropriate evaluation methodology for a machine learning system and\nmotivate this choice,\n• reason about ethical questions pertaining to machine learning systems.",
    "Course content": "The course gives an introduction to machine learning techniques and theory, with a\nfocus on its use in practical applications.\nDuring the course, a selection of topics will be covered in supervised learning, such as\nlinear models for regression and classification, or nonlinear models such as neural\nnetworks, and in unsupervised learning such as clustering.\nThe use cases and limitations of these algorithms will be discussed, and their\nimplementation will be investigated in programming assignments. Methodological\nquestions pertaining to the evaluation of machine learning systems will also be\ndiscussed, as well as some of the ethical questions that can arise when applying machine\nlearning technologies.\nThere will be a strong emphasis on the real-world context in which machine learning\nsystems are used. The use of machine learning components in practical applications will\nbe exemplified, and realistic scenarios will be studied in application areas such as e-\ncommerce, business intelligence, natural language processing, image processing, and\nbioinformatics. The importance of the design and selection of features, and their\nreliability, will be discussed.",
    "Sub-courses": "1. Take-home examination (Hemtentamen), 4 credits\nGrading scale: Pass with distinction (5), Pass with credit (4), Pass (3) and Fail (U)\n2. Assignments (Inlämningsuppgifter), 3.5 credits\nGrading scale: Pass with distinction (5), Pass with credit (4), Pass (3) and Fail (U)",
    "Form of teaching": "Lectures, exercise sessions, computer lab sessions.\nLanguage of instruction: English",
    "Assessment": "The course is examined by an individual written take-home examination, as well as\nmandatory written assignments submitted as written reports, some of which will be\ncarried out individually and others in groups of normally 2-4 students.\nLate submission of the take-home examination results in the grade Fail (U), unless\nspecial reasons exist. A failed take-home examination is reexamined by a new take-home\nexam.\nIf a student, who has failed the same examined component twice, wishes to change\nexaminer before the next examination, a written application shall be sent to the\ndepartment responsible for the course and shall be granted unless there are special\nreasons to the contrary (Chapter 6, Section 22 of Higher Education Ordinance).\nIn cases where a course has been discontinued or has undergone major changes, the\nstudent shall normally be guaranteed at least three examination occasions (including the\nordinary examination) during a period of at least one year from the last time the course\nwas given.",
    "Grades": "The grading scale comprises: Pass with distinction (5), Pass with credit (4), Pass (3) and\nFail (U).\nThe grading scale comprises Fail (U), 3, 4 or 5.\nTo pass the course, all mandatory components must be passed. To be awarded a higher\ngrade (4 or 5) for the full course, you need to have passed both the sub-courses with a\ngrade of 4 or 5, respectively.",
    "Course evaluation": "The course is evaluated through meetings both during and after the course between\nteachers and student representatives. Further, an anonymous questionnaire is used to\nensure written information. The outcome of the evaluations serves to improve the\ncourse by indicating which parts could be added, improved, changed or removed.",
    "Additional information": "The course is a joint course together with Chalmers.\nCourse literature to be announced the latest 8 weeks prior to the start of the course.\nThe course replaces the course DIT865, 7.5 credits. The course cannot be included in a\ndegree which contains DIT865. Neither can the course be included in a degree which is\nbased on another degree in which the course DIT865 is included.\nThe course cannot be included in a degree which contains the course DIT381."
