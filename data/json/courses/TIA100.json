    "Confirmation": "This course syllabus was confirmed by The IT Faculty Board on 2010-12-21 and was\nlast revised on 2017-08-07 by Department of Computer Science and Engineering to be\nvalid from 2017-08-20, autumn semester of 2017.",
    "Position in the educational system": "The course is provided as a part of the Computer Science Master's Programme N2COS.\nThe course is also offered as a programme course in the Computer Science Bachelor's\nProgramme N1COS. Please note the entrance qualifications for programme students in\nNICOS below for this course.\nThe course can be part of the following programmes: 1) Computer Science, Master's\nProgramme (N2COS), 2) Applied Data Science Master's Programme (N2ADS), 3)\nComputer Science, Bachelor's Programme (N1COS) and 4) Software Engineering and\nManagement Master's Programme (N2SOF)",
    "Entry requirements": "To be eligible to the course tha student must have a Bachelor degree of 180 hec.\nAdditionally, the course TIG095 Human Computer Interaction 7.5 credits, or the\nequivalent is required.\nTo be eligible for this course as a programme student in Science Bachelor's Programme\nNICOS, the student must have passed at least 90 credits in programme courses and the\nadditional course TIG095 Human Computer Interaction 7.5 credits.",
    "Learning outcomes": "After completing the course the student is expected to be able to:\nKnowledge and understanding\n• Understand and explain user-centrered design processes and different usability test\nmethods at a deep level\nSkills and abilities\n• Give a good overview of the field of Human-Centered Design theories and practices\n• Modify user centered design methods to fit the specific resources available\n• Apply, in a new context, the practical experience gained by performing the user-\ncentered design process in a real world setting\nJudgement and approach\n• Motivate the feasibility of usability to improve development processes.",
    "Course content": "The course consists of both theoretical and practical parts. The theoretical part presents\nthe history and development of Human-Centered Design (HCD) from research to\nindustrial applications. Relevant design theories and processes, such as user-centered\ndesign, rational unified process, ecological interface design and design of products for\nleisure and entertainment are covered in the course. Literature seminars provide\nadditional theoretical grounding and reflection, as well as different industrial practical\nexperience/problems where speakers representing different types of companies are\ninvited. The practical parts consist of laboratory work with usability evaluation\nmethods and carrying out an investigation project at industry. The industrial project will\nemphasize on\n1) how to investigate existing design process and usability problems in products,\n2) how to implement a HCD process in a specific company, and 3) how to motivate\npotential benefits of the usability concept and human-centered design process in\nindustry.\nThe project will be carried out in small groups.",
