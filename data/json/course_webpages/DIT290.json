    "About": "In this course the students first will get to know the points of inherent difference and strength of distributed systems compared with sequential or strongly-coupled systems; consequently.\n\nThe aim of the course is to teach the students to study the issues and problems that have to be addressed and solved efficiently for these differences to be taken advantage of, so that the system retains its strength and high potential.\n\nMore specifically the goal is to teach the students able to understand and solve all the problems that distributed systems like P2P, collaborative environment systems or even parts of the core internet techno have to solve in order to be able to function efficiently and correctly. The goal is to combine theoretical studies with their respective application oriented consequences.",
