    "About": "This course presents applications of stochastic calculus and partial\n\ndifferential equations in mathematical finance. Besides the basic\n\noptions on stocks and currency, the course deals also with interest rate\n\nmodels, stochastic volatility models and financial derivatives whose\n\nvalue depends on the history of the underlying stock. This course is\n\nalso fundamental for portfolio theory, which is however not treated in\n\nthe course.",
    "Entry requirements": "The equivalent of the course MMG810 Options and Mathematics or in all 90 credits in Mathematics and Mathematical statistics.",
