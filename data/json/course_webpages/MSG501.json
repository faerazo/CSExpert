    "About": "This course is very relevant for anyone working with data. Regression methods are the most important statistical tools to study the dependency between a target variable of interest (response) and several other variables (covariates).\n\nBy building a robust and interpretable regression model, you will be able to perform predictions and quantify the corresponding uncertainties.\n\nThe course integrates methodology with hands-on data analysis using the R software.\n\nMain topics:\n\n- linear regression model building: how to select important covariates\n\n- diagnostics: how to identify outliers and influential observations\n\n- inference: hypothesis testing and confidence intervals\n\n- robust modelling using cross-validation\n\n- generalized linear models: expanding beyond Gaussian errors",
