    "About": "Power and temperature have joined performance as first-class design goals. High- performance computing platforms now strive for the highest performance/watt. This course looks at the design of current multicore systems with an eye towards how those designs are likely to evolve over the next decade.\n\nA common thread running through all content parts is a discussion of cost tradeoffs with respect to performance, power, energy, verifiability, programmability, and maintainability. A second unifying theme is the memory bottleneck, and the importance of efficient resource management.",
