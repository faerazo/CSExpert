    "About": "The course covers the basic principles of database systems as seen by users, application programmers and database administrators. A laboratory assignment develops these topics as a running example throughout the course. These include programming in SQL, as seen by a user querying or modifying an existing database, by a database designer,\n\nand by an application programmer invoking SQL from a host language.\n\nCourse contents include:\n\n- entity-relationship modeling\n- functional dependencies and normalisation\n- database querying and manipulation through SQL\n- interfacing to a database from a host language (such as Java/JDBC)\n- overview of non-SQL models (such as JSON or XML)",
