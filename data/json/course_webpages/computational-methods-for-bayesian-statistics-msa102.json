    "About": "The course gives an introduction to Bayesian statistical modelling and inference, focusing on computational methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and other simulation methods, but also looking at tools such the EM algorithm. We emphasize the interplay between statistical modelling and applied problem solving, as well as computational and theoretical aspects of the models.",
