    "About": "Economic risks lead to catastrophic losses on a regular basis. Among the most spectacular examples are the tulip speculation back in the 17th century and the collapse of the Barings Bank in 1995. The course gives a short historical introduction to the subject as well as an introduction to some mathematical methods of economic risk analysis. Special attention is paid to the decision theory, actuarial mathematics and the concept of “Value at Risk”. The course consists of lectures, exercises and projects.",
