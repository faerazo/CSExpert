    "About": "The course will present classical mathematical topics from a computing science perspective: giving specifications of the concepts introduced, paying attention to syntax and types, and ultimately constructing DSLs of some mathematical areas mentioned below.\n\nThe lecture topics are:\n\n- Introduction to functional programming and calculational proofs\n\n- Introduction to Domain Specific Languages (DSLs): case study linear algebra\n\n- DSLs and mathematics: case study category theory\n\n- Real analysis: mean value theorems, Taylor formulas\n- Real analysis: a DSL for power series\n\n- More linear algebra: eigenvalues and optimization",
    "Entry requirements": "The student should have successfully completed:\n\n- 7.5 hec in discrete mathematics, for example DIT980 Introductory Discrete Mathematics for Computer Scientists\n\n- 15 hec in mathematics, for example MMGD20 Linear Algebra D and MMGD30 Calculus D\n\n- 15 hec in computer science, for example DIT440 Introduction to Functional Programming or MVG300 Programming with Matlab and DIT012 Imperative Programming with Basic Object-orientation\n\nAdditional 22.5 hec of any mathematics or computer science courses.",
    "Selection": "Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.",
