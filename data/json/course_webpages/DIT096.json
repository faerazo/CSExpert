    "About": "Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is a field which deals with the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive systems and studying phenomena around them. The aim of the course is to allow students to experience the most important phases of user-centered design:\n\n- understanding context of use,\n- charting requirements,\n- generating multiple design solutions and\n- evaluating prototypes with users.\n\nThe course consists of both theoretical and practical parts, and students learn about the different steps in the design process and relevant methods for designing for users. The course covers a broad area of designing interactive systems, which includes different types of interfaces and interaction modalities. The course prepares students to collaborate in an interdisciplinary environment with specialists in design and cognitive science.",
