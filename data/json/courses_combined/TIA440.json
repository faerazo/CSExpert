    "Position in the educational system": "This course is a compulsory course in Human-centered Artificial Intelligence Master's Programme (T2HAI).",
    "Entry requirements": "60 credits in in the Second-cycle, out of which at least 45 credits must be in Human-centered Artificial Intelligence.",
    "Learning outcomes": "On successful completion of the course the student will be able to:\n\n_Knowledge and understanding_\n\n- identify relevant and current themes within the field of human-centered AI;\n- choose an appropriate scientific approach in relation to a specific theme;\n\n_Competence and skills_\n\n- formulate relevant questions in relation to a specific theme within the field of human-centered AI;\n- independently design and conduct a scientifically well-founded study that contributes to the development of knowledge within the field of human-centered AI;\n- orally and in writing, present and discuss the conclusions of a scientific study and the knowledge and arguments that underpin them;\n\n_Judgement and approach_\n\n- critically and independently analyze and evaluate the results of studies in the field of human-centered AI;\n- critically assess and account for relevant scientific, societal, and ethical aspects in relation to studies within the field of human-centered AI.",
    "Course content": "The course provides the student with the opportunity to practice a scientific approach to relevant issues within the field of human-centered AI. The course includes motivating and arguing for a selected theme and an appropriate scientific approach, identifying and formulating relevant questions, designing and conducting a scientifically well-founded study, and orally and in writing presenting and discussing the study’s conclusions as well as the knowledge and arguments that underpin them. Furthermore, the course includes critically assessing and accounting for relevant scientific, societal, and ethical aspects, as well as evaluating the study’s results. The course involves planning the study, writing and defending one’s own thesis, and orally opposing another’s advanced-level thesis within the field of human-centered AI.",
    "Sub-courses": "Planning Report, 7.5 Credits\n\n\nMaster’s Thesis, 22.5 Credits",
    "Form of teaching": "The task consists of independent work, which can be carried out individually or in groups. The student conducts research, theoretical or applied, independently under the guidance of an academic supervisor. The department assigns a supervisor for each master’s thesis.\n\nLanguage of instruction: English",
    "Assessment": "The first part of the course involves writing a planning report with an associated mandatory examination seminar (7.5 credits). The course leader examines the first part of the course. The second part involves writing a master’s thesis, defending it, and orally opposing another’s thesis at a mandatory examination seminar. For this part, a co-examiner is appointed, whose assessment forms the basis for the final course grade.\n\nIf a student who has been failed twice for the same examination element wishes to change examiner before the next examination session, such a request is to be granted unless there are specific reasons to the contrary (Chapter 6 Section 22 HF).\n\nIf a student has received a certificate of disability study support from the University of Gothenburg with a recommendation of adapted examination and/or adapted forms of assessment, an examiner may decide, if this is consistent with the course’s intended learning outcomes and provided that no unreasonable resources would be needed, to grant the student adapted examination and/or adapted forms of assessment.\n\nIf a course has been discontinued or undergone major changes, the student must be offered at least two examination sessions in addition to ordinary examination sessions. These sessions are to be spread over a period of at least one year but no more than two years after the course has been discontinued/changed. The same applies to placement and internship (VFU) except that this is restricted to only one further examination session.\n\nIf a student has been notified that they fulfil the requirements for being a student at Riksidrottsuniversitetet (RIU student), to combine elite sports activities with studies, the examiner is entitled to decide on adaptation of examinations if this is done in accordance with the Local rules regarding RIU students at the University of Gothenburg.",
    "Grades": "The grading scale comprises: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U). The planning report is given either Pass (G) or Fail (U). Master's thesis, defense and discussion is given either Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) or Fail (U).\n\nTo obtain the grade Pass (G) for the whole course, the student must have obtained a Pass (G) grade on the planning report and the grade Pass (G) on the Master's thesis, defense and discussion. In order to obtain the grade Pass with Distinction (VG) for the whole course, the student must get a Pass with Distinction (VG) for the Master's thesis, and a Pass (G) grad on the other parts of the examination.",
    "Course evaluation": "After completion of the course the students are to be given the possibility of participating in an electronic course evaluation. The result and any changes to the course will be communicated to the students who carried out the evaluation and to the students who are to start the course.",
