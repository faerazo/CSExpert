    "About": "Calculus, including integration, differentiation, and differential equations are insufficient to model stochastic phenomena like noise disturbances of signals in engineering, uncertainty about future stock prices in finance, and microscopic particle movement in natural sciences. This course gives a solid basic knowledge of stochastic analysis and stochastic differential equations. Brownian motion calculus. Elements of Levy processes and martingales. Stochastic integrals.",
