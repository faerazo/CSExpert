    "About": "In this course you will study structural theorems for commutative rings, with applications in algebraic geometry, algebraic number theory, and complex analysis. To construct and study new commutative rings from known ones, you will look at polynomials, fractions, and congruences. We introduce a concept of dimension for commutative rings and relate it to the transcendence degree of extension fields. Finally, you will study Dedekind rings and (if we have time) p-adic numbers. The course is one of the first you will take as a graduate student in mathematics.",
    "Entry requirements": "Knowledge equivalent to 90 credits in mathematics, including the course MMG500 Algebraic Structures.",
    "Facilities": "Mathematical Sciences is a joint department of Chalmers/University of Gothenburg. Your education takes place in the spacious and bright premises of Mathematical Sciences at the Chalmers campus Johanneberg, where there are lecture halls, computer rooms and group rooms. Here you can also find student lunch room and reading room, as well as student counsellors and student office.",
