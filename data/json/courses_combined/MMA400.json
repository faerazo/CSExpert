    "About": "The course is about problems where the variables are not numbers (as in calculus), but functions or more abstract objects. A linear structure where the objects can be added and multiplied with scalars is combined with a geometric/topological structure, where we can measure distances and take limits of the objects.\n\nFunctional analysis arose in the first decades of the 20th century, when mathematicians discovered that methods used to solve integral equations and partial differential equations also could be used in more abstract settings. During the course you will study normed spaces, Banach and Hilbert spaces, fixed-point theorems, compactness, spectral theory for compact self-adjoint maps, the Fredholm alternative, and applications to differential and integral equations.",
