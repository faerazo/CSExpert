    "Entry requirements": "For admission to the course, passed result is required on\n• Dialogue systems\nor the equivalent.",
    "Learning outcomes": "On successful completion of the course the student is expected to be able to:\nKnowledge and understanding\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\naccount for how linguistic theory in pragmatics is relevant to, and can be\nimplemented in, dialogue systems\nexplain the basic functionality of the components of a typical (multimodal) dialogue\nsystem, and how these relate to each another in various architectures\naccount for methods of collection and processing of data relevant to the\ndevelopment of dialogue systems\naccount for the basic principles of some advanced frameworks for dialogue\nmanagement that go beyond simple state-based or form-based dialogue\nmanagement\naccount for various types of multimodality in dialogue systems\naccount for methods of analysis and evaluation of dialogue systems both \"glass-box\"\nand \"black-box\" methods\nSkills and abilities\n•\n•\n•\nanalyse and evaluate an existing dialogue system based on knowledge about\nfunction and design\nimplement a dialogue system application in one of the advanced dialogue\nmanagement frameworks discussed in the course\nwithin the frame of a project, using sound methodology for design, implementation\nand evaluation, in groups develop a larger (possibly multimodal) dialogue system\napplication\nJudgement and approach\n• problematise and scientifically evaluate design choices in dialogue systems\ndevelopment, e g concerning error handling, dialogue management and and\nmultimodality",
    "Course content": "The course gives in-depth knowledge about theories and methods for the design,\nimplementation and evaluation of dialogue systems, focusing particularly on:\n• Semantics and pragmatics for dialogue systems\n• Data collection and analysis\n• Advanced dialogue management\n• Multimodality\n• Evaluation of dialogue systems\n• Advanced implementation techniques",

    "Assessment": "The course is examined through labs, a project report, an oral presentation of the\nproject, and either an individually written project diary or a written exam ( decided by\nthe course coordinator).\nA student who has failed an examination twice on a course is entitled to have another\nexaminer appointed, if it is possible. The application shall be sent to the board of the\ndepartment and has to be in writing.",
    "Grades": "The grading scale comprises: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U).\nFor the grade Pass is required:\n• submitted labs, submitted project (including report) and written examination with\ngrade of Pass or submitted individually written project diary where the contribution\nof the student to the project as a whole is clear.\nTo pass with distinction is required furthermore:\n• that the submitted project (including report) has high quality, written examination\nwith grade Pass with distinction or a project diary where it appears that the\nindividual effort of the student has contributed to the high quality of the project.",
    "Course evaluation": "The director of studies or the equivalent is responsible to ensure that the result of the\ncourse evaluations of the students is compiled, is made available and forms the basis for\nthe development of the course.",
