    "Confirmation": "This course syllabus was confirmed by The IT Faculty Board on 2011-06-14 and was last revised on 2017-06-16 by Department of Computer Science and Engineering to be valid from 2017-08-20, autumn semester of 2007.",
    "Position in the educational system": "The course is a part of the Computer Science Master's programme and an elective course at the University of Gothenburg.\nThe course can be part of the following programmes: 1) Computer Science, Master's Programme (N2COS), 2) Applied Data Science Master's Programme (N2ADS) and 3) Game Design & Technology Master's Programme (N2GDT)",
    "Entry requirements": "To be eligible for the course students should have successfully completed two years studies within the subject Computer Science or equivalent. Specifically a course within Computer Graphics is required.",
    "Learning outcomes": "The course aims to give an understanding of components in modern interactive simulation engines.\nAfter completing the course the student is expected to be able to:\nKnowledge and understanding\n• Explain the typical structure of simulation engines and the requirements of specific parts of such engines.\n• Explain what public libraries and programs can be combined with simulation engines to provide the required functionality of an interactive simulation.\nSkills and abilities\n• Extend existing simulation engines to augment functionality while maintaining stability and having predictable consequences on resource use.\n• Present extensions of a simulation engine through demonstrators and public presentations.\nJudgement and approach\n• Analyze existing simulation engines to determine functionality and extendibility.\n• Plan several parallel extensions of a simulation engine while minimizing dependencies.",
    "Course content": "The modeling and implementation of the fundamental components of interactive simulations is the core of the Simulation Engine course. As given by the main use areas of these systems, simulations within the automobile and aviation industry and 3D games, the course focuses mainly upon 3 dimensional interactive simulations although other types of simulation are also included. The visual components of interactive simulations are given most focus within the course but connections to related areas such as networking, artificial intelligence and physics simulations are covered.",
    "Sub-courses": "",
    "Form of teaching": "Language of instruction: English",
    "Assessment": "The course is graded through two modules, namely:\n1. Group-based project work, 3.5 credits. Passing this module entails actively participating in all parts of the project including documentation and the final presentation.\n2. An individual report and engine expansion suggestion, 4.0 credits.\nA student who has failed the same examination twice has the right to request of the department a change of examiner. The request is to be writing and submitted as soon as possible. The department is to grant such a request without undue delay.",
    "Grades": "The grading scale comprises: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U).\nTo receive a passing grade all parts of the course must be completed with a\npassing grade. To pass with distinction, all modules must be completed with a\npassing grade and the sum of the marks for the group project and the individual\npart must be 80% or more of the highest possible marks.",
    "Course evaluation": "Students are to be given the opportunity to communicate their experience and views regarding the course they are in or have finished by participating in anonymous course evalution. As far as possible, evaluations are to be completed electronically. The results of course evaluations are to be made accessible to students. Processed results of the latest evaluation, including changes made or planned, are also to be made available to participants in the next round of the course.",
