    "Confirmation": "This course syllabus was confirmed by Department of Computer Science and\nEngineering on 2021-11-15 to be valid from 2022-08-29, autumn semester of 2022.",
    "Position in the educational system": "The course is part of the Computer Science Master's Programme. It is given as single\nsubject course at the University of Gothenburg.\nThe course can be part of the following programme: 1) Computer Science, Master's\nProgramme (N2COS)",
    "Entry requirements": "Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, or equivalent is required.\nThe student should have successfully completed the following courses (or equivalent):\n• DIT791 Introduction to ComputerEngineering, 7.5 hec,\n• DIT602 Algorithms, 7.5 hec,\n• DIT960 Data Structures, 7.5 hec, and\n•\nat least 7.5 hec in programming.\nFurthermore, the student should have completed 7.5 hec or equivalent in one of the four\nareas:\n• Computer Communication (such as DIT423 or equivalent), or\n• Operating Systems (such as DIT401 or equivalent), or\n• Computer Security (such as DIT641 or equivalent), or\n• Distributed Systems (such as DIT240 or equivalent).\nApplicants must prove knowledge of English: English 6/English B or the equivalent level\nof an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.",
    "Learning outcomes": "On successful completion of the course the student will be able to:\nKnowledge and understanding\n• List cyber-physical systems, and in particular information and communication\ntechnologies (ICT) methods for supporting adaptiveness and cybersecurity based on\nthe student's chosen area, for example, design of protocols or algorithms, security\nissues, data management and evaluation methodology,\n• Discuss current research and development in the area of such cyber-physical\nsystems, in order to meet the requirements of sustainable development in terms\nof security, economy and ecology,\nCompetence and skills\n• Design and analyse methods, algorithms, protocols for adaptive and cybersecure\ncyber-physical systems, such as smart power grid networks,\n• Work with advanced algorithms such as parallel or distributed algorithms for\nefficient data processing and adaptations or algorithmic implemetations of them so\nthat they can meet needs of the system in focus,\n• Plan and organize a small team project and document the work and the result in a\nreport,\nJudgement and approach\n• Present complex material to a small audience,\n• Work in a small-team project, on planning, scheduling and conducting the work,\n• Judge the relevance of the literature in a topic.",
    "Course content": "The course gives an introduction to new cyber-physical systems, such as the smart grid,\nwhere data has become very important for adaptive operations and with an increased\ndependence on information and communication technologies (ICT). Topics in the\ncourse are focused on new methods in the intersection of computer science and other\ndomains, to support distributed operations, cyber security, and processing of data that\nare generated due to digitalization of these systems (considering that the data can be\nmassive).\nThe content is focused on distributed computing and systems, data processing,\ninformation and systems security, networking and computer communication in the\ncontext of new cyber-physical systems. There are lectures from the faculty to give an\noverview of the areas of the course, and invited presentations from industry to talk\nabout actual systems, as well as in-depth presentations by the student themselves on\nspecific research topics relating to their projects.\nTypically, the lectures include an introduction to the new types of cyber-physical\nsystems, e.g., the smart grid. Open research problems in relation to distributed\noperations, data-processing and cyber security are discussed, e.g., through lectures on\nstreaming, security and privacy, and communication suitable in this domain. Examples\nof cyber-physical systems important for society are presented, e.g., the smart grid from\nboth on the transmission and distribution perspective. The course starts with an\nintroduction to power systems, to give students enough knowledge of terminology to\nunderstand papers connected to the smart grid.",
    "Sub-courses": "1. Project (Projekt), 7.5 credits\nGrading scale: Pass with distinction (5), Pass with credit (4), Pass (3) and Fail (U)",
    "Form of teaching": "Lectures, seminars, projects.\nThis project course setup includes a short sequence of introductory lectures given by\nlecturers and invited talks from the industry, that will prepare the students and allow\ntheir project groups to share a wider common background. The students will then\nchoose advanced topics related to their chosen projects, to study a set of problems in\ndepth. These topics are presented by the students to their peers and discussed in the\nclassroom. In addition, the students will write an individual report about their chosen\ntopic and a project report with their group.",
    "Assessment": "The course is examined through a written report on the project conducted by the\nstudents, and oral presentation, including demonstration. The written report is normally\ncarried out in small groups of students. The students also need to complete a small set of\nindividual reports, reflecting on the project and the group dynamics as well as giving\nfeedback on the work of other groups. There is also a short proposal for future projects\n(creation of new ideas). In order to pass the course the student is expected to also\nparticipate actively in seminars, including presentations and discussion of new topics. If\na student misses a mandatory seminar, he or she is then expected to complete an extra\nassignment.\nIf a student, who has failed the same examined component twice, wishes to change\nexaminer before the next examination, a written application shall be sent to the\ndepartment responsible for the course and shall be granted unless there are special\nreasons to the contrary (Chapter 6, Section 22 of Higher Education Ordinance).\nIn cases where a course has been discontinued or has undergone major changes, the\nstudent shall normally be guaranteed at least three examination occasions (including the\nordinary examination) during a period of at least one year from the last time the course\nwas given.",
    "Grades": "The grading scale comprises: Pass with distinction (5), Pass with credit (4), Pass (3) and\nFail (U).\nTo be awarded grade 3, the student shall demonstrate multi structural knowledge by\ncarrying out presentations and producing a report that is well structured and easy to\nread, that analyses a related problem using concepts defined by the course literature,\nthat properly cites the course literature, and whose content covers all learning outcomes.\nTo be awarded grade 4, the student shall demonstrate relational knowledge by carrying\nout presentations and producing a report that, that additionally analyses a related\nproblem synthesizing sources whose association was made by the student explicitly to\narrive at conclusions that cannot be made from a single perspective alone.\nTo be awarded grade 5, the student shall demonstrate advanced relational knowledge by\ncarrying out presentations and producing a report that, in addition, incorporates\nrelevant theories not covered by the course literature in the analysis and that synthesizes\nfindings from several theoretical perspectives to arrive at conclusions that are based on a\nmultitude of perspectives.",
    "Course evaluation": "The course is evaluated through meetings both during and after the course between\nteachers and student representatives. Further, an anonymous questionnaire is used to\nensure written information. The outcome of the evaluations serves to improve the\ncourse by indicating which parts could be added, improved, changed or removed.",
    "Additional information": "The course is a joint course together with Chalmers.\nCourse literature to be announced the latest 8 weeks prior to the start of the course,\nwhile the detailed list to support the student projects will be decided during the first\ncourse week.\nThe course replaces the course DIT615, 7.5 credits. The course cannot be included in a\ndegree which contains DIT615. Neither can the course be included in a degree which is\nbased on another degree in which the course DIT615 is included.\n\nLast modified\n\n20 February 2025",
    "Selection": "Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 285 credits",
    "Tuition": "Full education cost: 17 753 SEK\n\nFirst payment: 17 753 SEK\n\nNo fees are charged for EU and EEA citizens, Swedish residence permit holders and exchange students.\n\n[More information about tuition fees](https://www.gu.se/en/study-in-gothenburg/apply/tuition-fees)\n\nApplication closed, late application opens 15 July 2025."
