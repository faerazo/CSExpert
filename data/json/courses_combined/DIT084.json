    "Confirmation": "This course syllabus was confirmed by Department of Computer Science and Engineering on 2021-11-15 to be valid from 2022-08-29, autumn semester of 2022.",
    "Position in the educational system": "The course Testing, Debugging and Verification, 7.5 higher education credits, is a part of the Computer Science Bachelor's programme. It is also a single subject course at the University of Gothenburg.\nThe course can be part of the following programmes: 1) Computer Science, Master's Programme (N2COS), 2) Applied Data Science Master's Programme (N2ADS), 3) Computer Science, Bachelor's Programme (N1COS) and 4) Software Engineering and Management Master's Programme (N2SOF)",
    "Entry requirements": "To be eligible for the course students should have successfully completed 45 hec of an education aiming at a bachelor degree within Computer Science, Software Engineering or equivalent.\nWithin these 45 hec, the student should have successfully completed:\n• A 7.5 hec course in discrete mathematics (such as DIT980)\n• A 7.5 hec course in imperative/object-oriented programming (such as DIT012 or DIT953)",
    "Learning outcomes": "After completion of the course the student is expected to be able to.\nKnowledge and understanding\n• Describe the possibilities and limitations of both informal and formal techniques for the discovery, analysis, and resolving of program errors.\n• Describe the concept of precise specifications of software units.\n• Discuss the principles of software verification.\nCompetence and skills\n• Express precise specifications of software units.\n• Systematically discover inputs on which a program fails.\n• Locate, analyse, and fix the error which caused the failure.\n• Formally reason about simple programs for guaranteeing correctness.\nJudgement and approach\n• Judge the various error removal and prevention practices that one can encounter in a working context.\n• Contribute to the development and improvement of error removal and prevention techniques in a given context.\n• Follow up on, and take advantage of, conceptual and technical developments in the area of testing, debugging, and verification that go beyond the exact techniques covered in the course.",
    "Course content": "The main aim of the course is to provide a basic understanding of techniques that cope with errors in programs. Recurring themes are a) the identification of errors, b) their analysis, and c) their removal. The course also provides an understanding of systematic ways to convince oneself that a program unit really does what it should.\nThe course covers formal and informal methods, testing (terminology, coverage, unit tests, a unit test framework), debugging (control, workflow, localisation, tools), formal specifications (pre-/postconditions, invariants), formal verification (logics, tool support). Throughout, the course is concerned with imperative programs in general, and object-oriented programs in particular.\nAfter the course, student have understood - and are able to employ - the methods testing (trying to reveal the presence of errors in a systematic way), debugging (the act of isolating and fixing errors), and verification (reasoning about programs in order to guarantee correctness). All these methods only make sense in the presence of a specification of what the program is supposed to do.",
    "Sub-courses": "1. Written hall examination (Skriftlig salstentamen), 5 credits\nGrading scale: Pass with distinction (5), Pass with credit (4), Pass (3) and Fail (U)\n2. Laboratory work (Laboration), 2.5 credits\nGrading scale: Pass (G) and Fail (U)",
    "Form of teaching": "The course consists of lectures, exercise classes and laboratory work.",
    "Assessment": "The course is examined by a final individual written hall examination 5.0 hec at the end of the course, and laboratory work (hand-ins) 2.5 hec. The laboratory work (hand-ins) is usually done in groups of 2-3 students. In case a hand-in is not passed in the first attempt, the student is granted a second try.\nIf a student, who has failed the same examined element on two occasions, wishes to change examiner before the next examination session, such a request is to be submitted to the department in writing and granted unless there are special reasons to the contrary (Chapter 6, Section 22 of Higher Education Ordinance).\nIn the event that a course has ceased or undergone major changes, students are to be guaranteed at least three examination sessions (including the ordinary examination session) over a period of at least one year, though at most two years after the course has ceased/been changed. The same applies to work experience and VFU, although this is restricted to just one additional examination session.",
    "Grades": "The grading scale comprises: Pass with distinction (5), Pass with credit (4), Pass (3) and Fail (U).\nTo pass the course, students must receive a passing grade in both modules. The grade for the entire course will be determined by the written exam.",
    "Course evaluation": "The course is evaluated through meetings both during and after the course between teachers and student representatives. Further, an anonymous questionnaire is used to ensure written information. The outcome of the evaluations serves to improve the course by indicating which parts could be added, improved, changed or removed.",
    "Additional information": "The course is a joint course together with Chalmers.\nCourse literature will be announced at the latest 8 weeks prior to the start of the course.\nThe course replaces the course DIT083 Testing, debugging and verification, 7.5credits. The course cannot be included in a degree which contains DIT083. Neither can the course be included in a degree which is based on another degree in which the course DIT083 is included.\nThe course cannot be included in a degree which contains DIT635. Neither can the course be included in a degree which is based on another degree in which the course DIT635 is included\n\nLast modified 20 February 2025",
    "Selection": "Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.",
    "Tuition": "Full education cost: 17 753 SEK\n\nFirst payment: 17 753 SEK\n\nNo fees are charged for EU and EEA citizens, Swedish residence permit holders and exchange students.\n\n[More information about tuition fees](https://www.gu.se/en/study-in-gothenburg/apply/tuition-fees)"
