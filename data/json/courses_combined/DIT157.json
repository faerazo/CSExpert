    "Confirmation": "This course syllabus was confirmed by Department of Computer Science and Engineering on 2020-11-24 to be valid from 2022-01-17, spring semester of 2022.",
    "Position in the educational system": "The course is also offered as a single subject course.\n\nThe course can be part of the following programmes: 1) Computer Science, Master's Programme (N2COS), 2) Game Design & Technology Master's Programme (N2GDT) and 3) Software Engineering and Management Master's Programme (N2SOF)\n\nMain field of studies\nInteraction Design\nComputer Science-Interaction Design\n\nSpecialization\nA1F, Second cycle, has second-cycle course/s as entry requirements\nA1F, Second cycle, has second-cycle course/s as entry requirements",
    "Entry requirements": "Bachelor degree 180 hec and the courses DIT095 Human computer interaction, 7.5 hec and DIT104 Interaction design methodology, 7.5 hec or equivalent.\n\nApplicants must prove knowledge of English: English 6/English B or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.",
    "Learning outcomes": "After completion of the course the student should be able to:\n\nKnowledge and understanding\n• Explain what \"User Experience\" means, and give an account of the most common theories and approaches within the area.\n• Describe UX-oriented design methods as well as their underlying theories.\n• Analyze and discuss a certain design in terms of user experience and design goals.\n\nCompetence and skills\n• Analyze possible user experiences provided by an interactive system or object.\n• Choose and apply suitable design methods.\n• Design towards a certain user experience, making it permeate all aspects of the artifact.\n• Be able to motivate ones design decisions in relation to the user experience one is designing for.\n• Give and receive constructive feedback regarding design for user experiences.\n\nJudgement and approach\n• Be able to apply related approaches and theories in order to discuss, or design a certain user experience.\n• Be able to conclude and discuss the ethical and societal consequences of designing a certain user experience.",
    "Course content": "After the course you should have a clear idea of some aesthetic ideals and how to design according to them, giving a valid design rationale. Designing interactive systems it often, but not always about designing for efficiency. However, it is just as important to design the experience of use, as the functionality of the artifact in itself, although they are closely intertwined. Apart from designing for efficiency, we can also aim for playfulness, criticism, embodiment or various emotions (e.g. fear, joy, comfort), all of which create different user experiences. In this course we will look closer at different kinds of user experiences and discuss and practice how to design for them.\n\nContent includes, but is not limited to:\n\n• What it means to design for a user experience.\n• Common views and approaches towards designing user experiences.\n• Analysis of possible user experiences provided by an interactive system or object.\n• The connection between design objectives, design rationale and design decisions.",
    "Sub-courses": "1. Project (Projekt), 3.5 credits\nGrading scale: Pass with distinction (5), Pass with credit (4), Pass (3) and Fail (U)\n\n2. Literature seminars (Litteraturseminarier), 2 credits\nGrading scale: Pass (G) and Fail (U)\n\n3. Exercises (Övningar), 2 credits\nGrading scale: Pass (G) and Fail (U)",
    "Form of teaching": "The course features both practical and theoretical parts, as well as work in groups and individual work. Lectures and literature seminars give a theoretical foundation, which are immediately put into practice. Focus is upon turning analysis and reflection into practical action. Focus is also on exchange of thoughts, feedback, designs and ideas. Hence, the course requires active participation.\n\nLanguage of instruction: English",
    "Assessment": "The course is examined through three modules:\n\n1. Literature seminars, where literature is presented along with an issue and is discussed (2 hec).\n2. Exercises where various design methods that focus on the user experience in a design process is practiced.The exercises also give training in giving and taking constructive criticism (2 hec).\n3. One individual project (3,5 hec).\n\nIf a student, who has failed the same examined component twice, wishes to change examiner before the next examination, a written application shall be sent to the department responsible for the course and shall be granted unless there are special reasons to the contrary (Chapter 6, Section 22 of Higher Education Ordinance).\n\nIn cases where a course has been discontinued or has undergone major changes, the student shall normally be guaranteed at least three examination occasions (including the ordinary examination) during a period of at least one year from the last time the course was given.",
    "Grades": "The grading scale comprises: Pass with distinction (5), Pass with credit (4), Pass (3) and Fail (U).\nTo pass the course, students must receive a passing grade in all modules. The grade for the entire course will be determined by the project.",
    "Course evaluation": "After completion of the course the students are to be given the possibility of participating in course anonymously. The processed results of the course evaluations are to be made accessible to students and also made available to new students at the beginning of the next course. The results of and possible changes to the course will be shared with students who participated in the evaluation and students who are starting the course.",
    "Additional information": "The course is a joint course together with Chalmers.\n\nCourse literature to be announced the latest 8 weeks prior to the start of the course.\n\nThe course replaces the course TIA243, 7.5 credits. The course cannot be included in a degree which contains TIA243. Neither can the course be included in a degree which is based on another degree in which the course TIA243 is included."
