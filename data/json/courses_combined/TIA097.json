    "Position in the educational system": "The course is provided as a part of the Computer Science Master's Programme N2COS. The course is also offered as a programme course in the Computer Science Bachelor's Programme, N1COS. Please note the entrance qualifications for programme students in N1COS below for this course. The course is also offered as a single subject course.\nMain field of studies\nInteraction Design\nComputer Science-Interaction Design\nSpecialization\nAIN, Second cycle, has only first-cycle course/s as entry requirements\nAIN, Second cycle, has only first-cycle course/s as entry requirements",
    "Entry requirements": "To be eligible for the course the student must have a Bachelor degree of 180 credits. Additionally, the course Human Computer Interaction (TIG095) 7.5 credits, or the equivalent is required. In addition, students need to have successfully completed the courses Graphical Interfaces (TIA106), 7.5 credits and Interaction Design Methodology (TIA104) 7.5 credits, at advanced level.\nTo be eligible for this course as a programme student in Science Bachelors Programme N1COS, the student must have passed at least 90 credits in programme courses and the additional course Human Computer Interaction (TIG095) 7.5 credits and the courses Graphical Interfaces (TIA106), 7.5 credits and Interaction Design Methodology (TIA104) 7.5 credits, at advanced level.",
    "Learning outcomes": "After completing the course the student is expected to be able to:\nKnowledge and understanding\n•Motivate and give the design rationale for decisions in an interaction design process\nSkills and abilities\n• Apply user evaluation methods in practice\n• Apply design methods systematically\n•Identify needs and requirements of specific intended user groups\n•Carry out a design project from concept to working prototype adhering to given constraints\n•Present design proposals to a critical audience\n•Present and document work through both oral and written presentations\nJudgement and approach\n•Create and critically compare concept ideas\n•Critique a design based on aesthetics and expression\n•Predict the potential effects for all relevant stakeholders of a design.",
    "Course content": "The course aims at a deepened understanding of central design issues in interaction design by means of practical training in design projects. The course focuses on giving the students throughout training and experience from interaction design work.",
    "Sub-courses": "",
    "Form of teaching": "",
    "Assessment": "In addition to creating working prototypes, the course contains lectures, exercises and literature seminars. Design projects are carried out in groups, under supervision. Progress reports and user tests are made several times during the project and the results are presented at a concluding public presentation.\nThe course is examined by one module, named Project 15hp (U-VG).\nA student who has failed a test twice has to right to change examiners, if it is possible. A written application should be sent to the Department.",
    "Grades": "The grading scale comprises Fail (U), Pass (G), Pass with Distinction (VG).",
    "Course evaluation": "Continuous evaluation will be used, including three meetings between teacher(s) and student representatives. Additionally, the course will be evaluated with a course questionnaire, and discussed with the student representatives.",
