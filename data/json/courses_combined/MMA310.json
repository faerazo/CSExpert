    "About": "In this course you will study polynomial equations over fields, using group theory. Among other things, we will show that there is no general formula with root expressions for the solutions of polynomial equations of degree five. We do this by classifying algebraic extension fields, using the symmetric groups of the fields. As a byproduct, we will determine which of the regular polygons can be constructed with compass and ruler.",
