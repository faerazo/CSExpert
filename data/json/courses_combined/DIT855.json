    "Confirmation": "This course syllabus was confirmed by Department of Computer Science and\nEngineering on 2017-06-09 to be valid from 2017-08-28, autumn semester of 2017.",
    "Position in the educational system": "The course is a compulsory course in the Applied Data Science Master's Programme,\nand can also be given as a single-subject course at the University of Gothenburg.\nThe course can be part of the following programme: 1) Applied Data Science Master's\nProgramme (N2ADS)",
    "Entry requirements": "To be eligible for the course the student should have successfully completed university\nlevel courses of at least 30 hec.",
    "Learning outcomes": "On successful completion of the course the student will be able to:\nKnowledge and understanding\n• Explain different aspects of mathematical thinking: mathematical reasoning,\nproblem solving, modelling.\n• Explain how mathematical thinking can be applied in different areas.\nSkills and abilities\n• Show familiarity with basic mathematical concepts such as definitions, theorems, as\nwell as different kinds of mathematical reasoning and proofs (mathematical\nreasoning).\n• Solve complex and unknown problems with a structured and investigative approach\n(mathematical problem solving).\n• Investigate real problems, determine if they can be seen from a mathematical\nperspective and translate to mathematical problems, and adapt mathematical\nconclusions to the real problem (mathematical modelling).\n• Communicate about and with the help of mathematics.\n• Use different mathematical tools as a natural part of thinking and working\nmathematically.\nJudgement and approach\n• Show ability to balance previous knowledge and own thinking.\n• Show a reflective attitude to the course contents and to your own thinking.\n• Show care for precision and quality in all work.",
    "Course content": "The course is mainly intended to strengthen the students' mathematical thinking, and\ntheir ability to apply such thinking in applications, and in their continued studies. The\nfocus in not on mathematical knowledge in the traditional sense, but on the often\nimplied abilities needed to effectively be able to apply the mathematics you already\nknow, and efficiently be able to learn new mathematics. The most important parts are\nmathematical reasoning, problem solving and modelling. Important aspects such as\nusing the computer as a part of your mathematical thinking, and to be able to\ncommunicate with and about mathematics are also integrated in the course. The course\nwill also pointwise relate to mathematics at the university level.\nBy developing the ability to think mathematically, the course complements other more\ntraditional courses in mathematics, and by providing the student with experience of\ndifferent areas of application, the gap between mathematical theory and relevant\napplications is bridged.\nThe core of the course is a number of carefully selected problems, used as starting points\nfor the student's own learning, where student by working in an investigative way\ndevelop their own abilities. We also have lectures which provide a broader\nunderstanding, follow-up and perspective. The problems illustrate many different areas\nof application, and their level of difficulty is adapted to efficiently practice the abilities\nto think and work mathematically in different situations.",
    "Sub-courses": "",
    "Form of teaching": "The course is mainly organized in modules. For every module there is an introductory\nlecture and a compulsory follow-up lecture providing feedback on the problems of the\nmodule.\nThe learning is supported by an interactive way of teaching with a lot of contact\nbetween students and teachers. This occurs during supervision hours where students\nwork with the problems and regularly discuss with the supervisors. They will then\nreceive individual feedback and guidance in their own problem solving, and develop\ntheir independent abilities.\nLanguage of instruction: English",
    "Assessment": "The course is examined through written assignments and with a final report, where the\nstudents are encouraged to summarize and reflect over the course in a personal way. The\nassignments and the final report are normally written in groups of two persons.\nTo pass the course, attendance of selected lectures is also required.\nIf a student, who has failed the same examined component twice, wishes to change\nexaminer before the next examination, a written application shall be sent to the\ndepartment responsible for the course and shall be granted unless there are special\nreasons to the contrary (Chapter 6, Section 22 of Higher Education Ordinance).\nIn cases where a course has been discontinued or has undergone major changes, the\nstudent shall normally be guaranteed at least three examination occasions (including the\nordinary examination) during a period of at least one year from the last time the course\nwas given.",
    "Grades": "The grading scale comprises: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U).\nThe possible grades of the course are Pass with distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U).\nTo pass the course, the assignments and the final report must pass. To get the grade Pass\nwith distinction (VG), this grade is required both for the assignments and for the final\nreport.\nTo pass the final report, the student needs to show a basic understanding of the course\ncontents, and the presentation and the content of the report must be correct and\npossible to understand. To get the grade Pass with distinction (VG) on the report, the\nstudent must show a deeper understanding of the subject, describing own insights and\nshowing particular attention to quality.\nTo pass the assignments the reasoning must be correct, and fulfil basic measures of\nquality. To get the grade Pass with distinction (VG) on the assignments, the student\nmust show a deeper understanding of the subject, describing own insights and showing\nparticular attention to quality.",
    "Course evaluation": "The course is evaluated through meetings both during and after the course between\nteachers and student representatives. Further, an anonymous questionnaire is used to\nensure written information. The outcome of the evaluations serves to improve the\ncourse by indicating which parts could be added, improved, changed or removed.",
