    "About": "This course in optimization primarily treats large-scale, difficult, and often combinatorial optimization problems. You will study different methods of tackling such problems, through a lecture series and working on projects in a group. You will also touch on current research topics such as optimality conditions for non-convex optimization, column generation, and Lagrange duality. The course will conclude with an algorithm contest, where you compete by choosing the best and/or quickest approach to solving a problem!",
    "Entry requirements": "The prerequisite for the course Large-Scale Optimization is the equivalent of the course MMG621 Nonlinear Optimization or equivalent of the course MMG631 Linear and Integer Optimization with Applications.",
    "Selection": "All eligible applicants who have applied before the deadline will be granted a place.",
    "Tuition": "Full education cost: 17 753 SEK\nFirst payment: 17 753 SEK\n**No fees** are charged for EU and EEA citizens, Swedish residence permit holders and exchange students.\n[More information about tuition fees](https://www.gu.se/en/study-in-gothenburg/apply/tuition-fees)",
