    "Confirmation": "This course syllabus was confirmed by Department of Computer Science and Engineering on 2021-11-15 to be valid from 2022-08-29, autumn semester of 2022.",
    "Position in the educational system": "The course is offered within several programmes.\n\nThe course can be part of the following programmes: 1) Computer Science, Master's Programme (N2COS), 2) Applied Data Science Master's Programme (N2ADS), 3) Game Design & Technology Master's Programme (N2GDT) and 4) Software Engineering and Management Master's Programme (N2SOF)",
    "Entry requirements": "The student shall have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or another relevant area.\n\nIn addition, a mandatory pre-requisite to take this course is that the student has the necessary knowledge to take the specific instance of this course.\n\nApplicants must prove knowledge of English: English 6/English B or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.",
    "Learning outcomes": "After completion of the course the student should be able to:\n\nKnowledge and understanding\n• Understand and explain the terminology, concepts and theories associated with the research area of the course\n• Describe and explain the research area of the course, and show insight into current research and development\n• Describe and explain research methods within the research area of the course\n\nCompetence and skills\n• Critically and systematically integrate knowledge and to analyse, assess, and deal with complex issues in the research area of the course\n• Clearly communicate the key ideas, concepts and results in the area of the course both orally and in writing\n\nJudgement and approach\n• Search for, and extract, necessary information from scientific publications in the research area of the course, with the purpose of identifying strengths and weakness of solutions, approaches and methodologies",
    "Course content": "This course will deal with an area of current interest within the general area of computer science, software engineering, interaction design or data science.\n\nThe course gives students the chance to follow a graduate course or another research centered course.",
    "Sub-courses": "1. Examination (Examination), 7.5 credits\nGrading scale: Pass with distinction (5), Pass with credit (4), Pass (3) and Fail (U)",
    "Form of teaching": "The organisation of the course may include lectures, tutorials, seminars, and/or labs and supervision in conjunction with these.",
    "Assessment": "The examination might vary on each instance of the course. It might consist of a written or take-home exam, assignments, presentation of work in a seminar, or a combination of these. Further information will be given on the home page for each instance of the course.\n\nIf a student, who has failed the same examined component twice, wishes to change examiner before the next examination, a written application shall be sent to the department responsible for the course and shall be granted unless there are special reasons to the contrary (Chapter 6, Section 22 of Higher Education Ordinance).\n\nIn cases where a course has been discontinued or has undergone major changes, the student shall normally be guaranteed at least three examination occasions (including the ordinary examination) during a period of at least one year from the last time the course was given.",
