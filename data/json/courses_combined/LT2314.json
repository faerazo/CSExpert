    "Confirmation": "This course syllabus was confirmed by Department of Philosophy, Linguistics and\nTheory of Science on 2018-05-29 and was last revised on 2023-05-29 to be valid from\n2023-08-28, autumn semester of 2023.",
    "Position in the educational system": "The course can be part of the following programmes: 1) Applied Data Science Master's\nProgramme (N2ADS) and 2) Master in Language Technology (One year or Two years)\n(H2MLT)",
    "Entry requirements": "Admission to the course requires having passed the following courses:\n• LT2001 Introduction to programming 7.5 credits\n• LT2002 Introduction to formal linguistics 7.5 credits\n• LT2003 Natural language processing, 15 credits (or LT2123 Basic skills for\nlanguage technology, 7.5 credits together with LT2124 Themes in NLP and\nlanguage technology, 7.5 credits)\n• LT2212 Statistical methods 7.5 credits (or LT2222 Machine learning for statistical\nNLP: introduction 7.5 credits)\nor equivalent language technology competence.\nEnglish 6 or equivalent is also required.",
    "Learning outcomes": "On successful completion of the course the student will be able to:\nKnowledge and understanding\n• describe which types of algorithms are used in language technology research and\ndevelopment and choose suitable algorithms for a given problem,\n• describe challenges and open problems in advanced text-based language technology\nproblems,\n• describe existing language technology and data structure algorithms and their\npossible application on above mentioned problems,\n• describe existing resources and algorithms and understand how these can be merged\nto tackle new problems and purposes,\n• describe evaluation models with their limitations, pros and cons.\nCompetence and skills\n• choose, develop or adapt algorithms, tools or resources for a given purpose and\ndomain,\n• use at least an existing implementation of algorithm or a tool or a resource,\n• choose an evaluation model based on a given problem and purpose.\n• perform work according to a predetermined schedule.\nJudgement and approach\n• Assess if a specific algorithm, tool or resource can be used for a given purpose and\ndomain,\n• interpret evaluation results in relation to a given purpose and domain,\n• justify your choice and need of a specific resource for a given purpose and domain.",
    "Course content": "The course gives advanced knowledge in algorithmic resources for language technology\n(or language technology tools) such as algorithms for word sense and disambiguation,\nlearning algorithms and sentence level classification. Language technology resources,\nsuch as corpora, dictionary, syntax, text and language models are covered with relevant\nalgorithms. The course is thematic organised in the following main parts:\n• Algorithmic resources for language technology\n• Advanced language technology problems in text-based language technology\n• Use of resources in language technology research and development",
    "Sub-courses": "",
    "Form of teaching": "The teaching is given in the form of lectures, laboratories, assignments, seminars,\nexercises, individual work, or group work.\nTwo teaching sessions a week during the first four weeks, thereafter individual work\nwith the project. During the project work it is possible to meet the lecturers and discuss\nwith them. Submission and project presentation at the end of the course.\nLanguage of instruction: English",
    "Assessment": "The course is assessed by written and/or oral tests. Compulsory attendance can apply\nfor some course elements.\nThe grading teacher may request completion of examined student achievements.\nA student who has taken two exams in a course or part of a course without obtaining a\npass grade is entitled to the nomination of another examiner. The student needs to\ncontact the department for a new examiner, preferably in writing, and this should be\napproved by the department unless there are special reasons to the contrary (Chapter 6\nSection 22 of the Higher Education Ordinance).\nIf a student has received a recommendation from the University of Gothenburg for\nspecial educational support, where it is compatible with the learning outcomes of the\ncourse and provided that no unreasonable resources are required, the examiner may\ndecide to allow the student to sit an adjusted exam or alternative form of assessment.\nIn the event that a course has ceased or undergone major changes, students are to be\nguaranteed at least three examination sessions (including the ordinary examination\nsession) over a period of at least one year, but no more than two years, after the course\nhas ceased/been changed. The same applies to placements and professional placements\n(VFU), although this is restricted to just one additional examination session.",
    "Grades": "The grading scale comprises: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U).\nRequirements for Pass:\n• passed course essay and course assignment oral presentation\n• passed practical assignment\nRequirements for Pass with distinction:\n• course essay passed with distinction and good quality of course assignment oral\npresentation\n• practical assignment passed with distinction by having merged\nalgorithms/tools/resources or by having implemented a supplement or an addition\nto an existing algorithm, tool or resource.",
    "Course evaluation": "Students participating in, or having completed the course, are given the chance to\nanonymously submit their opinions of and suggestions for the course in a course\nevaluation. A short version of the course evaluation, together with the reflections of the\ncourse coordinator, is published and made available to the students within a reasonable\ntime after the course has finished. The next time the course will be given, a short version\nof the course evaluation will be presented together with any measures implemented..",
    "Additional information": "The course requires access to a computer (or similar) with internet access.\n\n13 March 2025",
    "Selection": "Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.",
    "Tuition": "Full education cost: 18 878 SEK\n\nFirst payment: 18 878 SEK\n\n**No fees** are charged for EU and EEA citizens, Swedish residence permit holders and exchange students.\n\n[More information about tuition fees](https://www.gu.se/en/study-in-gothenburg/apply/tuition-fees)"
