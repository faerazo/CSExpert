    "Confirmation": "This course syllabus was confirmed by Department of Computer Science and\nEngineering on 2019-02-07 and was last revised on 2019-11-20 to be valid from 2020-08-\n31, autumn semester of 2020.",
    "Position in the educational system": "The course is compulsory within the programme N2GDT. It is also a single subject\ncourse at the University of Gothenburg.\nThe course can be part of the following programme: 1) Game Design & Technology\nMaster's Programme (N2GDT)",
    "Entry requirements": "To be eligible for this course, students must have successfully completed the following\ncourses, or equivalent:\n- TIA265 Game Engine Architecture, 7.5 credits\nApplicants must prove knowledge of English: English 6/English B or the equivalent level\nof an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.\nThe courses TIA248 Introduction to Game Research and TIA098 Gameplay Design are\nrecommended.",
    "Learning outcomes": "On successful completion of the course the student will be able to:\nKnowledge and understanding\n• list potential for new game mechanics and gameplay of two different technologies\n• state creativity methods and techniques for applying new technologies to gameplay\nCompetence and skills\n•\n•\n• develop and explore new gameplay produced by using new technologies\npresent new aspects of a game's gameplay based upon the new technology used\napply creativity methods on a new technology for creating new gameplay\nJudgement and approach\n•\n•\nanalyse potential advantages and disadvantages of various new technology-driven\ngameplay possibilities given the context of specific user groups\nasses ethical and societal issues of wide-spread adaptation of new technology-driven\ngameplay",
    "Course content": "Advances in computer game and game development are often tied intrinsically to the\ndevelop of new technology. However, the potential use of new technology is typically\neasier to identify regarding graphics, sound, networking, and even business aspects than\nregarding the core of a game, its game mechanics or gameplay. The course technology-\ndriven experimental game design focuses upon developing skills for understanding and\napplying new technologies specially towards enabling new forms of gameplay.\nTwo currently relevant new technologies are introduced in the course (which\ntechnologies vary between years). Creativity methods are taught in the course as a\npreparation for applying these methods during the work on the specific technologies.",
    "Sub-courses": "1. Project (Projekt), 7.5 credits\nGrading scale: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U)",
    "Form of teaching": "The course is divided into two major modules and a smaller introductory module. The\ntwo major modules each focus on a technology which is on the cusp of being able to\ninfluence game development significantly within a couple of years. Each module\nintroduces a technology through lectures, literature, and practice along with tools to\nallow gameplay experiments. The two major modules each contain a group submission\nand an individual submission. Group work usually takes place in groups of 5-6 students.\nThe smaller introductory module goes through concepts and creativity methods for use\nin the other modules.\nLanguage of instruction: English",
    "Assessment": "The smaller introductory component consists of an individual written submission. Each\nof the two major components consists of a group submission, an individual written\nsubmission and an oral presentation in a group.\nThe report in the introductory component and the oral presentations are either failed or\npassed. The group reports and the individual reports in the two major components use a\ngrading scale for correction.\nIf a student, who has failed the same examined component twice, wishes to change\nexaminer before the next examination, a written application shall be sent to the\ndepartment responsible for the course and shall be granted unless there are special\nreasons to the contrary (Chapter 6, Section 22 of Higher Education Ordinance).\nIn cases where a course has been discontinued or has undergone major changes, the\nstudent shall normally be guaranteed at least three examination occasions (including the\nordinary examination) during a period of at least one year from the last time the course\nwas given.",
    "Grades": "The grading scale comprises: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U).\nThe grading scale comprises: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U).\nThe final grade is based on the average grade of the group reports and the individual\nreports.",
    "Course evaluation": "The course is evaluated through meeting after the course between teachers and student\nrepresentatives. Further, an anonymous questionnaire is used to ensure written\ninformation. The outcome of the evaluations serves to improve the course by indicating\nwhich parts could be added, improved, changed or removed.",
    "Additional information": "The courses TIA098 Gameplay Design and TIA248 Introduction to Game Research or\nequivalent are recommended.\nThe course is a joint course together with Chalmers.\nCourse literature to be announced the latest 8 weeks prior to the start of the course.\nThe course replaces the course DIT465, 7.5 hec. The course cannot be included in a\ndegree which contains DIT465. Neither can the course be included in a degree which is\nbased on another degree in which the course DIT465 is included."
