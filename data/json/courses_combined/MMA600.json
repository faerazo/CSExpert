    "About": "In this course you will study numerical techniques for approximating the solutions of linear systems of equations, least squares problems and eigenvalue problems. You will learn about relevant applications and about the mathematical background of these problems, and how the algorithms are constructed. By solving problems and doing computer exercises you will learn to apply current methods, study their resource use and judge how reliable the results are.",
