    "About": "This is an introductory course in programming, and uses a functional language. The primary goal is to enable students to write small programs, while introducing some of the fundamental concepts of computer science. Secondary goals are to provide orientation regarding the courses to come (particularly data structures, algorithms, digital circuits, formal methods and programming language courses).\n\nConcrete topics encountered in the course include:\n\n- values, types and functions\n- compound data types (lists, tuples, and user-defined types)\n- higher-order functions\n- using abstraction to avoid repetitive programming\n- recursion and recursive data types\n- efficient and inefficient programs\n- input-output\n- verification with the help of testing",
    "Entry requirements": "Mathematics 3c or Mathematics D",
    "Selection": "Selection is based upon average grade from upper secondary school (34 %), the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits (33 %) and Högskoleprovet - Swedish Scholastic Aptitude Test (33 %).",
    "Tuition": "Full education cost: 17 753 SEK\n\nFirst payment: 17 753 SEK\n\nNo fees are charged for EU and EEA citizens, Swedish residence permit holders and exchange students.\n\n[More information about tuition fees](https://www.gu.se/en/study-in-gothenburg/apply/tuition-fees)",
