    "Confirmation": "This course syllabus was confirmed by The Faculty of Arts on 2011-01-17 and was last revised on 2017-06-01 by Department of Philosophy, Linguistics and Theory of Science to be valid from 2017-08-28, autumn semester of 2017.",
    "Position in the educational system": "The course is part of the 'Master's in Language Technology' programme (H2MLT). It can be offered as an elective course in the Applied Data Science masterprogramme (N2ADS). It can also be offered as a freestanding course.\nThe course is part of the 'Master's in Language Technology' programme (H2MLT) and Applied Data Science masterprogramme (N2ADS).\n\nThe course can be part of the following programmes: 1) Applied Data Science Master's Programme (N2ADS) and 2) Master in Language Technology (One year or Two years) (H2MLT)",
    "Entry requirements": "Admission to the course requires either successful completion of the course\n• LT2113 Natural Language Processing, 15 hecr\nor successful completion of the two courses\n• LT2103 Natural Language Processing, 7.5 hecr\n• LT2104 Programming for NLP, 7.5 hecr\nor equivalent language technology skills and knowledge.",
    "Learning outcomes": "After completion of the course the students are expected to be able to:\nKnowledge and understanding\n• account for the differences between the types of semantic analysis covered in the\ncourse\n• write semantic interpretation rules for basic semantic constructions in English and at\nleast one other language\nSkills and abilities\n• implement semantic grammars using tools provided by programming languages\nand/or grammar development systems\nJudgment and approach\n• make informed judgments about selecting the type of semantics needed for\nparticular language technology applications\n• evaluate particular implemented semantic grammars and construct evaluation\nmaterials such as test suites",
    "Course content": "The course gives a basic introduction to model theoretical semantics for natural language (as developed for example in Montague semantics and Discourse Representation Theory) and its implementation using suitable programming techniques. It also introduces theorem proving and its application to reasoning in natural language applications.",
    "Sub-courses": "",
    "Form of teaching": "There are laboratory exercises that require attendance for a passing grade.\nLanguage of instruction: English",
    "Assessment": "The examination consists of participation in laboratory exercises, assignments and a written exam.\nA student who has failed an examination twice has the right to change examiners if it is feasible. A written application should be sent to the board of the department.",
    "Grades": "The grading scale comprises: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U).",
