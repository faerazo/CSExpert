    "Confirmation": "This course syllabus was confirmed by Department of Mathematical Sciences on 2022-12-20 to be valid from 2023-08-28, autumn semester of 2023.",
    "Position in the educational system": "The course is part of the Master's Programme in Mathematical Sciences, but it is also open for students outside the program who meet the course prerequisites.\n\nThe course can be part of the following programmes: 1) Mathematical Sciences, Master's Programme (N2MAT) and 2) Applied Data Science Master's Programme (N2ADS)",
    "Entry requirements": "Basic skills in mathematical statistics.\nBasic skills in scientific programming (for example in Matlab or R) as achieved by completing MSG400 \"Stochastic Data Processing and Simulation\".",
    "Learning outcomes": "On successful completion of the course the student will be able to\n• explain and apply a Bayesian approach to probability inference\n• implement important computational algorithms for Bayesian inference, for example\nMetropolis-Hastings MCMC\n• make independent and informed decisions about statistical modeling and\ncomputational choices\n• present his or her analysis in a structured and pedagogical way.",
    "Course content": "• Philosophy of Bayesian statistics.\n• Conjugate priors and improper priors.\n• Approximate methods for low-dimensional parameter spaces.\n• Basic sampling methods.\n• Monte Carlo integration.\n• Advanced sampling methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).\n• Hierarchical models.\n• Computations for Bayesian Networks.\n• Basic information theory.\n• The EM algorithm.\n• Basic variational Bayes methods.",
    "Sub-courses": "",
    "Form of teaching": "Lectures and computer based hand-in assignments.",
    "Assessment": "Compulsory computer based hand-in assignments. The grade will be based on a written examination at the end of the course.\n\nIf a student, who has failed the same examined component twice, wishes to change examiner before the next examination, a written application shall be sent to the department responsible for the course and shall be granted unless there are special reasons to the contrary (Chapter 6, Section 22 of Higher Education Ordinance).",
    "Grades": "The grading scale comprises: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U).",
    "Course evaluation": "Oral and/or written course evaluation will be performed. The results of the evaluation and possible changes to the course will be shared with students who participated in the evaluation and students who are starting the course.",
    "Additional information": "The course MSA102 Computational Methods for Bayesian Statistics has partially the same content as the courses MSA101 Computational Methods for Bayesian Statistics and MSA100 Computer Intensive Statistical Methods. It is not allowed to be examined in more than one of these courses.\n\nLast modified: 18 February 2025",
    "Selection": "All eligible applicants who have applied before the deadline will be granted a place.",
    "Tuition": "Full education cost: 17 753 SEK\n\nFirst payment: 17 753 SEK\n\nNo fees are charged for EU and EEA citizens, Swedish residence permit holders and exchange students.\n\n[More information about tuition fees](https://www.gu.se/en/study-in-gothenburg/apply/tuition-fees)\n\nApplication closed, late application opens 15 July 2025."
