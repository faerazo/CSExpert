    "Confirmation": "This course syllabus was confirmed by The IT Faculty Board on 2011-02-22 and was\nlast revised on 2019-11-19 by Department of Computer Science and Engineering to be\nvalid from 2020-08-31, autumn semester of 2020.",
    "Position in the educational system": "The course is offered within several programmes. It is also a single subject course at the\nUniversity of Gothenburg.\nThe course can be part of the following programmes: 1) Computer Science, Master's\nProgramme (N2COS), 2) Applied Data Science Master's Programme (N2ADS) and 3)\nGame Design & Technology Master's Programme (N2GDT)",
    "Entry requirements": "To be eligible for the course the student must have succesfully completed a bachelor\nthesis course, e.g. DIT561. In addition, the student must succesfully have completed a\n7,5 HEC course in Human Computer Interaction, e.g. TIG095 or TIG091.",
    "Learning outcomes": "After completing the course the student is expected to be able to:\nKnowledge and understanding\n• Describe stages of the design process\n• Describe methods for working with interaction design\n• Describe the similarities and differences of different design methods\n• Describe considerations for involving users in the design process\n• Explain the difference between the methods employed in craftsmanship, traditional\ndesign, and modern design\nCompetence and skills\n• Design technology with regards to users\n• Modify design methods to fit the context and needs of users\n• Identify needs and requirements for users\n• Develop and describe new design methods\n• Plan design projects with respect to design goals, stakeholders' requirements, and\navailable resources and expertise\n• Conduct work in an inter-cultural environment (including both cultural and\neducational backgrounds)\nJudgement and approach\n• Analyze designs taking into account the needs of users\n• Make an informed evaluation of the ethical and societal impacts of a design\n• Criticize designs and design processes with respect to the methods used\n• Identify ethical and social dilemmas in interaction design research and practice\n• Reflect on your own design process objectively\n• Design with regards to aesthetical issues of interaction",
    "Course content": "The aim of the course is to introduce basic design methodology in interaction design\nwith focus on design issues related to user experience and aesthetics.\nThe course consists of several smaller exercises, a group project, and an individual\nexamination. Theory is combined with practical training to give students training in\nworking systematically with the design of computational things and systems in\nheterogeneous groups. Training in specific design methods are provided through\nexercises and the group project while meta methods such as iterative design are aspects\nof the group project.",
    "Sub-courses": "1. Written take-home exam (Hemtentamen), 4 credits\nGrading scale: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U)\n2. Project (Projekt), 3.5 credits\nGrading scale: Pass (G) and Fail (U)",
    "Form of teaching": "The course is based on lectures, exercises, project, and an individual exam.",
    "Assessment": "The student is graded through a group project (3 hec) and an individual take-home\nexamination (4,5 hec). The take-home examination includes a written assignment and\nthree exercises.\nIf a student, who has failed the same examined component twice, wishes to change\nexaminer before the next examination, a written application shall be sent to the\ndepartment responsible for the course and shall be granted unless there are special\nreasons to the contrary (Chapter 6, Section 22 of Higher Education Ordinance).\nIn cases where a course has been discontinued or has undergone major changes, the\nstudent shall normally be guaranteed at least three examination occasions (including the\nordinary examination) during a period of at least one year from the last time the course\nwas given.",
    "Grades": "The grading scale comprises: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U).\nThe grading scale comprises: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U).\nA Pass grade (G) for the course requires at least a Pass grade on both the take-home\nexamination and the group project. A Pass with Distinction grade (VG) for the entire\ncourse requires a Pass with Distinction (VG) on the take-home examination and at least\na Pass grade (G) for the group project.",
    "Course evaluation": "The course is evaluated through meeting after the course between teachers and student\nrepresentatives. Further, an anonymous questionnaire is used to ensure written\ninformation. The outcome of the evaluations serves to improve the course by indicating\nwhich parts could be added, improved, changed or removed.",
    "Additional information": "The course is a joint course together with Chalmers.\nCourse literature to be announced the latest 8 weeks prior to the start of the course."
