    "About": "The course is mainly intended to strengthen the students’ mathematical thinking, and their ability to apply such thinking in applications, and in their continued studies. The focus is not on mathematical knowledge in the traditional sense, but on the often implied abilities needed to effectively be able to apply the mathematics you already know, and efficiently be able to learn new mathematics. The most important parts are mathematical reasoning, problem solving and modelling. Important aspects such as using the computer as a part of your mathematical thinking, and to be able to communicate with and about mathematics are also integrated in the course. The course therefore includes occasional running and understanding of simple given computer programs.The course also in a natural way introduces basic mathematical knowledge useful in computer science and other areas, including a selection of Swedish upper secondary courses Mathematics 4 and 5.By developing the ability to think mathematically, the course complements other more traditional courses in mathematics, and by providing the student with experience of different areas of application, the gap between mathematical theory and relevant applications is bridged.\n\nThe core of the course is a number of carefully selected problems, used as starting points for the student’s own learning, where student by working in an investigative way develop their own abilities. We also have lectures which provide a broader understanding, follow-up and perspective. The problems illustrate many different areas of application, and their level of difficulty is adapted to efficiently practice the abilitiesto think and work mathematically in different situations.\n\nIn connection with the exercises, we also discuss different problem solving strategies, reflect on solutions, and compare different ways to solve the same problem. We also give an orientation about the role of mathematics in various applications and demonstrate the importance of mathematical computer models.",
    "Entry requirements": "To enter the course, 7,5 hec in mathematics (calculus, linear algebra, mathematical statistics and/or discrete mathematics) are needed.",
    "Selection": "Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.",
    "Tuition": "Full education cost: 19 253 SEK\n\nFirst payment: 19 253 SEK\n\nNo fees are charged for EU and EEA citizens, Swedish residence permit holders and exchange students.\n\n[More information about tuition fees](https://www.gu.se/en/study-in-gothenburg/apply/tuition-fees)",
