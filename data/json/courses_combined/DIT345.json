    "Confirmation": "This course syllabus was confirmed by Department of Computer Science and\nEngineering on 2021-11-15 to be valid from 2022-08-29, autumn semester of 2022.",
    "Position in the educational system": "The course is compulsory within the Software Engineering and Management Bachelor's\nProgramme. It is also a single subject course at the University of Gothenburg.\nThe course can be part of the following programme: 1) Software Engineering and\nManagement Bachelor's Programme (N1SOF)",
    "Entry requirements": "To be eligible for this course, students must have successfully completed the course\nDIT045 Requirements and User Experience, 7.5 credits, or equivalent.",
    "Learning outcomes": "On successful completion of the course the student will be able to:\nKnowledge and understanding\n• describe the role of an architect in a software development project, and what may be\nexpected from such a person\n• explain common quality requirements, such as performance, security, and\nmodifiability\n• describe different architectural styles and how they relate to specific quality\nproperties of the architecture\nCompetence and skills\n• document architectures using established methods\n• solicit requirements from stakeholders and describe these as quality requirements\n• express quality requirements using quality scenarios\n• create an architectural design of a system based on a case description in natural\nlanguage\nJudgement and approach\n• reason about how different architectural styles, tactics or design alternatives meet\nthe quality goals of a system",
    "Course content": "The aim of this course is to equip students with basic knowledge and skills about\nsoftware architecture design and its role in the development and maintenance of\nsoftware systems.\nThis course covers various definitions of software architecture. We discuss the role and\nrelevance of software architecture at different stages of development projects; we discuss\nthe relation of architecture to requirements and system implementation; we discuss\nsoftware architecture quality properties; we discuss various architectural styles and\ntactics; we discuss general software design principles; we discuss how to document and\nhow to evaluate software architectures.",
    "Sub-courses": "1. Written examination (Skriftlig tentamen), 4.5 credits\nGrading scale: Pass with distinction (5), Pass with credit (4), Pass (3) and Fail (U)\n2. Assignments (Inlämningsuppgifter), 3 credits\nGrading scale: Pass (G) and Fail (U)",
    "Form of teaching": "The teaching consists of lectures, exercises and examination parts, as well as supervision\nin connection to the exercises.",
    "Assessment": "The course is examined by an individual written exam carried out in an examination hall\nand written assignments carried out in groups of students. The assignments part is\nexamined on the basis of solutions to compulsory problems handed in during the course\nand on the basis of individual contribution to the group work. Students are required to\ncomplete written self- and peer-assessment forms during the course which will be part of\nthe assessment of the student's individual contribution to the project. Retake\nexaminations of the assignments part consist of additional individual assignments.",
    "Grades": "The grading scale comprises: Pass with distinction (5), Pass with credit (4), Pass (3) and\nFail (U).\nIn order to pass the course both the assignments and the written hall examination have\nto be approved. The final grade in the course is decided from the grade of the written\nhall examination.",
    "Course evaluation": "The course is evaluated through meeting after the course between teachers and student\nrepresentatives. Further, an anonymous questionnaire is used to ensure written\ninformation. The outcome of the evaluations serves to improve the course by indicating\nwhich parts could be added, improved, changed or removed.",
    "Additional information": "The course is a joint course together with Chalmers.\nCourse literature to be announced the latest 8 weeks prior to the start of the course.\nThe course replaces the course DIT344, 7.5 credits. The course cannot be included in a\ndegree which contains DIT344. Neither can the course be included in a degree which is\nbased on another degree in which the course DIT344 is included."
