    "About": "**Recent years have seen drastic developments in terms of digitalisation in sports. The use of digital technology in sports affects how sports teams are organized and managed, how we gain access to sports information and design new sports equipment. Digitization has also created new sports, such as e-Sports, which have major consequences for the perception of what sports are and how sports are practiced. The development of analytical technology to support performance improvement has also been intensified with the help of digitalisation.**\n\nThis course gives you the opportunity to acquire and apply knowledge about digitalisation in sports as a general societal phenomenon as well as professionalized specialized activities.
