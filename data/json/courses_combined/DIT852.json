    "Confirmation": "This course syllabus was confirmed by Department of Computer Science and\nEngineering on 2018-02-02 and was last revised on 2019-12-02 to be valid from 2020-08-\n31, autumn semester of 2020.",
    "Position in the educational system": "The course is a compulsory course within the Applied Data Science Master's\nProgramme.\nThe course can be part of the following programme: 1) Applied Data Science Master's\nProgramme (N2ADS)",
    "Entry requirements": "To be eligible to the course, the student should have a Bachelor's degree. Specifically, at\nleast 7,5 credits of successfully completed courses in programming are required.\nApplicants must prove knowledge of English: English 6/English B or the equivalent level\nof an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.",
    "Learning outcomes": "On successful completion of the course the student will be able to:\nKnowledge and understanding\n• describe fundamental types of analysis problems arising in data science\n• give examples of data science applications from different contexts\n• describe basic mathematical concepts in data science and understand how they can\nbe realized in data science applications\n\nCompetence and skills\n•\n•\nuse appropriate libraries and programming techniques to implement basic\ntransformations, visualizations and analyses of example data\napply simple machine learning methods implemented in a standard library\n• identify appropriate types of analysis problems for concrete applications\n\nJudgement and approach\n• reflect on inherent limitations of results of data science methods\n• critically analyze data science applications with respect to ethics and privacy",
    "Course content": "The course gives an introduction to applied data science using case studies from\ndifferent application domains and a primer in using Python for data science.\nIn the course, the following topics will be covered:\n•\n•\n•\n• mathematical and statistical concepts useful in data science, such as basic set theory,\nlogic, functions, and probability theory,\ncase studies of data science applications displaying a range of application areas and\nfundamental types of analysis problems,\na brief introduction to working in a Unix/Linux environment and programming to\nimplement basic transformations, visualizations and analyses,\nuse of a machine learning library to analyse data,\n• demonstration of inherent limitations of computational analyses with examples,\n• implications on privacy and ethical considerations.",
    "Sub-courses": "1. Written examination (Skriftlig tentamen), 4 credits\nGrading scale: Pass (G) and Fail (U)\n\n2. Assignments (Inlämningsuppgifter), 3.5 credits\nGrading scale: Pass (G) and Fail (U)",
    "Form of teaching": "Lectures, computer sessions, and exercise sessions.",
    "Assessment": "The course is examined by an individual written hall examination, as well as mandatory\nwritten assignments submitted as written reports, some of which will be carried out\nindividually and others in groups of normally 2-4 students.\nThere will be non-obligatory individual assignments which grant bonus points for the\nwritten examination. These bonus points are valid for the whole academic year.\nIf a student, who has failed the same examined component twice, wishes to change\nexaminer before the next examination, a written application shall be sent to the\ndepartment responsible for the course and shall be granted unless there are special\nreasons to the contrary (Chapter 6, Section 22 of Higher Education Ordinance).\nIn cases where a course has been discontinued or has undergone major changes, the\nstudent shall normally be guaranteed at least three examination occasions (including the\nordinary examination) during a period of at least one year from the last time the course\nwas given.",
    "Grades": "The grading scale comprises: Pass (G) and Fail (U).\nA Pass grade (G) for the entire course requires at least a Pass grade for all sub-courses.",
    "Course evaluation": "The course is evaluated through meeting after the course between teachers and student\nrepresentatives. Further, an anonymous questionnaire is used to ensure written\ninformation. The outcome of the evaluations serves to improve the course by indicating\nwhich parts could be added, improved, changed or removed.",
    "Additional information": "The programming language Python will be used in this course and in some other courses\nin the Applied Data Science Master's programme for examples and assignments.\nCourse literature to be announced the latest 8 weeks prior to the start of the course.\nThe course replaces the course DIT851, 7.5 credits. The course cannot be included in a\ndegree which contains DIT851. Neither can the course be included in a degree which is\nbased on another degree in which the course DIT851 is included.\nThis course cannot be included in a degree which contains DIT405 Introduction to data\nscience and AI."
