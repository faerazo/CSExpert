    "Position in the educational system": "The course can be part of the following programmes: 1) Mathematical Sciences,\nMaster's Programme (N2MAT) and 2) Applied Data Science Master's Programme\n(N2ADS)\nMain field of studies\nComputer Science\nData Science\nSpecialization\nA1F, Second cycle, has second-cycle\ncourse/s as entry requirements\nA1F, Second cycle, has second-cycle\ncourse/s as entry requirements",
    "Entry requirements": "To be eligible to the course, the student should have a Bachelor's degree in any subject.\nIn addition, the course requires:\n• 7.5 credits of courses in programming or equivalent,\n• a course including probability and statistics, such as DIT862 Statistical Methods for\nData Science or MSG810 Mathematical Statistics and Discrete mathematics,\n• a first course in machine learning, such as DIT866 Applied Machine Learning,\nDIT381 Algorithms for Machine Learning and Inference, or MSA220 Statistical\nLearning for Big Data.\nApplicants must prove knowledge of English: English 6/English B or the equivalent\nlevelof an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.",
    "Learning outcomes": "On successful completion of the course the student will be able to:\nKnowledge and understanding\n• describe the fundamentals of storing textual data for the world's languages,\n• describe the most common types of natural language processing tasks,\n• describe the most common types of machine learning models used in modern\nnatural language processing,\n• explain how text data can be annotated for a natural language processing task where\nmachine learning techniques are used.\nCompetence and skills\n• apply software libraries using machine learning for common natural processing\ntasks,\n• write the code to implement some machine learning models for natural language\nprocessing,\n• apply evaluation methods to assess the quality of natural language processing\nsystems.\nJudgement and approach\n• discuss the advantages and limitations of different machine learning models with\nrespect to a given task in natural language processing,\n• reason about what type of data could be useful when training a model for a given\nnatural language processing task,\n• select the appropriate evaluation methodology for a natural language processing\nsystem and motivate this choice,\n• reason about ethical questions pertaining to machine learning based natural\nlanguage processing systems, such as stereotypes and under-representation.",
    "Course content": "The course gives an introduction to machine learning models and architectures used in\nmodern natural language processing (NLP) systems.\nRapid developments in machine learning have revolutionized the field of NLP,\nincluding for commerically important applications such as translation, summarization,\nand information extraction. However, natural language data exhibit a number of\npeculiarities that make them more challenging to work with than many other types of\ndata commonly encountered in machine learning: natural language is discrete,\nstructured, and highly ambiguous. It is extremely diverse: not only are there thousands\nof languages in the world, but in each language there is substantial variation in style and\ngenre. Furthermore, many of the phenomena encountered in language follow long-tail\nstatistical distributions, which makes the production of training data more costly. For\nthese reasons, machine learning architectures for NLP applications tend to be quite\ndifferent from those used in other fields.\nThe course covers the following broad areas:\n• Working practically with text data, including fundamental tasks such as\ntokenization and word counting;\n• probabilistic models for text, such as topic models;\n• overview of the most common types of NLP applications;\n• architectures for representation in NLP models, including word embeddings,\nconvolutional and recurrent neural network, and attention models;\n• machine learning models for common types of NLP problems, mainly\ncategorization, sequence labeling, structured prediction and generation;\n• approaches to transfer learning in NLP.",
    "Sub-courses": "1. Project (Projekt), 7.5 credits\nGrading scale: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U)",
    "Form of teaching": "Lectures and assignments.\nLanguage of instruction: English",
    "Assessment": "The course is examined by mandatory written assignments submitted as written reports,\nas well as a self-defined project that requires the submission of a written report and an\noral presentation. Some of the assignments will be carried out individually and others in\ngroups of normally 2-4 students. The project is conducted by 2-4 students.\nA late submission of the assignments or project results in the grade Fail (U), unless\nspecial reasons exist. A failed assignment or project will be given the opportunity to\nsubmit a new solution on subsequent occasions the course is given.\nIf a student, who has failed the same examined element on two occasions, wishes to\nchange examiner before the next examination session, such a request is to be submitted\nto the department in writing and granted unless there are special reasons to the contrary\n(Chapter 6, Section 22 of Higher Education Ordinance).\nIn the event that a course has ceased or undergone major changes, students are to be\nguaranteed at least three examination sessions (including the ordinary examination\nsession) over a period of at least one year, though at most two years after the course has\nceased/been changed. The same applies to work experience and VFU, although this is\nrestricted to just one additional examination session.",
    "Grades": "The grading scale comprises: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U).\nA passing grade for the entire course requires at least a passing grade for all assignments\nand the project. To be awarded a higher passing grade for the entire course, the student\nmust, in addition, have a higher average on the weighted grades on the assignments and\nthe project.",
    "Course evaluation": "The course is evaluated through meetings both during and after the course between\nteachers and student representatives. Further, an anonymous questionnaire is used to\nensure written information. The outcome of the evaluations serves to improve the\ncourse by indicating which parts could be added, improved, changed or removed.\nThe results of and possible changes to the course will be shared with students who\nparticipated in the evaluation and students who are starting the course.",
    "Additional information": "The course is a joint course together with Chalmers.\nCourse literature will be announced at the latest 8 weeks prior to the start of the course"
