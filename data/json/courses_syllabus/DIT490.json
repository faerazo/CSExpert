    "Confirmation": "This course syllabus was confirmed by Department of Computer Science and Engineering on 2017-12-19 to be valid from 2018-08-19, autumn semester of 2018.",
    "Position in the educational system": "The course is offered within the programme Game Design & Technology Master's\nProgramme. It is also a single subject course at the University of Gothenburg.\nThe course can be part of the following programme: 1) Game Design & Technology\nMaster's Programme (N2GDT)",
    "Entry requirements": "To be eligible for this course, students must have successfully completed the courses\nTIA104/TDA496 Interaction design methodologies, 7.5 credits, and TIA106/TDA492\nGraphical interfaces, 7.5 credits, or equivalent.\nApplicants must prove knowledge of English: English 6/English B or the equivalent level\nof an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.",
    "Learning outcomes": "After completion of the course the student should be able to:\nKnowledge and understanding\n• Describe how project reports can be structured and what they should contain\n• Show how referencing of sources should be used in academic texts\nCompetence and skills\n• Independently carry out a small project in interaction design following established\nbest practices and procedures in small projects in interaction design\n• Document project work in a suitable form given the nature of the project\n• Do appropriate literature and background research for a small project\nJudgement and approach\n• Establish an appropriate scope for a project plan to make best possible use of all\nresources available, including skill sets and time\n• Reflect upon potential social and ethical problems that may arise from the result of\nthe project",
    "Course content": "The course provides the student with an opportunity to individually or in a smaller\ngroup (1-3 people) study something of relevance in the area of interaction design outside\nof the regular syllabus. The project can focus upon implementation of software as long\nas there is a clear connection to interaction design.\nStudents (preferably with varying backgrounds) perform a development project.\nSuitable project ideas should be developed in collaboration with a teacher. The group\nshould develop design or software (under supervision). The development should be\nbased on a plan that is created in advance of the project start. The plan should contain\ngoal of the project, planned process, and planned result.",
    "Sub-courses": "",
    "Form of teaching": "Independent project work typically in groups of 1-3 people, with supervision. The work\nshall start based upon the plan developed before the course starts, document how the\nwork progresses, including any changes to the plan, and end with the writing of a report.",
    "Assessment": "The course is examined via an individual written report. Common parts are allowed but\nshould be noted.

    "Course evaluation": "The course is evaluated through meeting after the course between teachers and student\nrepresentatives. Further, an anonymous questionnaire is used to ensure written\ninformation. The outcome of the evaluations serves to improve the course by indicating\nwhich parts could be added, improved, changed or removed.",
