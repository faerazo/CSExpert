    "Confirmation": "This course syllabus was confirmed by The IT Faculty Board on 2006-11-17 and was last revised on 2014-11-13 by Department of Computer Science and Engineering to be valid from 2015-08-30, autumn semester of 2015.",
    "Position in the educational system": "The course is a part of the Computer Science Master's Programme and an elective course at University of Gothenburg.\nThe level for the course in relation to degree requirements is Master's degree, code AXX.\nThe course can be part of the following programmes: 1) Computer Science, Master's Programme (N2COS), 2) Computer Science, Bachelor's Programme (N1COS) and 3) No translation available (NDATM)",
    "Entry requirements": "To be eligible for the course\nstudents should have successfully completed a first year within the subject Computer Science or equivalent. Specifically a course in linear algebra is required.\nApplicants must prove knowledge of English: English 6/English B or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.",
    "Learning outcomes": "Knowledge and understanding\nAfter completing the course the student is expected to be able to:\n• have a good knowledge of how computer graphics are implemented\n• understand the fundamental algorithms and processes used to create computer\ngraphics in 3D-games and movies\n• understand how to utilize the functionality of dedicated hardware support for\ngraphics through programming interface\nSkills and abilities\nAfter completing the course the student is expected to be able to:\n•\nimplement algorithms to generate real-time renderings and photo realistic\nrenderings\nJudgement and approach\nAfter completing the course the student is expected to be able to:\n•\nimplement effective algorithms to generate 2-dimensional images from 3-\ndimensional models.",
    "Course content": "The course provides knowledge of the principles used to create images through computer algorithms. The primary focus is on real-time rendering and photo realistic rendering. The first part of the course covers real-time rendering, and techniques for e.g. illumination, special effects, shadows and reflections will be studied. Design of graphics hardware and speedup algorithms will also be treated. The second part focus on generating photo-realistic images and includes studying of ray tracing and global illumination. In addition, the corresponding Mathematics will be revealed. The course contains some programming tutorials giving the students practical skills concerning programming for 3D-graphics.",
    "Sub-courses": "",
    "Form of teaching": "Language of instruction: English\nThe course is given in English.",
    "Assessment": "The student is examined by assignments done in a group or individually and a written exam done individually in an examination hall. A student who has failed a test twice has the right to change examiners, if it is possible. A written application should be sent to the Department. A student who has failed a test twice has the right to change examiner, unless weighty argument can be adduced. The application shall be sent to the department and has to be in writing.",
    "Grades": "The grading scale comprises: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U).",
    "Course evaluation": "The course is evaluated through meetings both during and after the course between teachers and student representatives. Further, an anonymous questionnaire can be used to ensure written information. The outcome of the evaluations serves to improve the course by indicating which parts could be added, improved, changed or removed.",
