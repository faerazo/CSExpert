    "Confirmation": "This course syllabus was confirmed by Department of Computer Science and Engineering on 2020-01-21 to be valid from 2020-08-31, autumn semester of 2020.",
    "Position in the educational system": "The course can be part of the following programmes: 1) Mathematical Sciences, Master's Programme (N2MAT), 2) Computer Science, Master's Programme (N2COS), 3) Computer Science, Bachelor's Programme (N1COS), 4) Bachelor's Programme in Mathematics (N1MAT) and 5) Software Engineering and Management Master's Programme (N2SOF)\nMain field of studies\nComputer Science\nData Science\nSpecialization\nG1F, First cycle, has less than 60 credits in first-cycle course/s as entry requirements\nG1F, First cycle, has less than 60 credits in first-cycle course/s as entry requirements",
    "Entry requirements": "To be eligible for the course students should have:\n• 7,5 hec mathematical thinking (DIT025 or DIT856 or equivalent) or a course in basic mathematics (containing e.g. calculus, linear algebra, discrete mathematics).\n• 7,5 hec mathematical statistics (e.g. MSG810 or DIT862 or DIT278 or similar) or the two courses DIT847 and DIT278 (or equivalent).\n• 7,5 hec Programming in a General-Purpose Language (e.g. C/C++/Java/Python or similar.",
    "Learning outcomes": "On successful completion of the course the student will be able to:\nKnowledge and understanding\n• describe fundamental types of problems and main approaches in data science and ΑΙ;\n• give examples of data science and AI applications from different contexts;\n• give examples of how stochastic models and machine learning (ML) are applied in data science and AI;\n• explain basic concepts in classical AI, and the relationship between logical and data driven, ML-based approaches within AI;\n• briefly explain the historical development of AI, what is possible today and discuss possible future development.\nCompetence and skills\n• use appropriate programming libraries and techniques to implement basic transformations, visualizations and analyses of example data;\n• identify appropriate types of analysis problems for some concrete data science applications;\n• implement some types of stochastic models and apply them in data science and AI applications;\n• implement and/or use AI-tools for search, planning and problem solving;\n• apply simple machine learning methods implemented in a standard library.\nJudgement and approach\n• justify which type of statistical method is applicable for the most common types of experiments in data science applications;\n• discuss advantages and drawbacks of different types of approaches and models within data science and AI;\n• reflect on inherent limitations of data science methods and how the misuse of statistical techniques can lead to dubious conclusions;\n• critically analyze and discuss data science and AI applications with respect to ethics, privacy and societal impact;\n• show a reflective attitude in all learning.",
    "Course content": "During the course, a wide selection of methods for Data Science and AI will be introduced. The course is divided into three parts:\nIntroduction to data science\n• Implementation of data science solutions, using Python, basic data analysis and visualization.\n• Introduction of the data science process, and appropriate methodology.\n• Examples of core data science methods with case studies such as in clustering, classification and regression.\n• Data science put in context regarding ethics, regulations and limitations.\nStatistical methods for data science and AI\n• Introduction of some common stochastic models with examples of applications in data science and AI (for instance, naive Bayes classifiers, topic models for text and Hidden Markov Models for sequence data).\nArtificial Intelligence\n• Introduction to classical AI and machine learning, including the relationship to related areas such as algorithms and optimization, and AI philosophy.\n• Examples of methods and applications of AI, in classical AI (search and constraint satisfaction), and ML-based (search engines, naive Bayes and neural networks)\n• Discussion of ethics and societal impact of AI.",
    "Sub-courses": "1. Assignments (Inlämningsuppgifter), 7.5 credits\nGrading scale: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U)",
    "Form of teaching": "Language of instruction: English",
    "Assessment": "The course is examined via compulsory written assignments, usually one assignment per week. Compulsory lectures and seminars can be added, as specified in the course PM. As a part of the basis for the grading process, the students will declare in writing their respective contributions to the assignments within their group.\nIf a student, who has failed the same examined element on two occasions, wishes to change examiner before the next examination session, such a request is to be submitted to the department in writing and granted unless there are special reasons to the contrary (Chapter 6, Section 22 of Higher Education Ordinance).\nIn the event that a course has ceased or undergone major changes, students are to be guaranteed at least three examination sessions (including the ordinary examination session) over a period of at least one year, though at most two years after the course has ceased/been changed. The same applies to work experience and VFU, although this is restricted to just one additional examination session.",
    "Grades": "The grading scale comprises: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U).\nThe grading scale comprises: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U).\nTo pass the course, all weekly assignments must be passed. To earn a higher grade than Pass, a higher weighted average from the grades of the assignments is required.",
    "Course evaluation": "The course is evaluated through meetings both during and after the course betweenteachers and student representatives. Further, an anonymous questionnaire is used toensure written information. The outcome of the evaluations serves to improve thecourse by indication which parts could be added, improved, changed or removed.\nThe results of and possible changes to the course will be shared with students who participated in the evaluation and students who are starting the course.",
    "Additional information": "The course is a joint course together with Chalmers.\nCourse literature will be announced at the latest 8 weeks prior to the start of the course.\nThe course cannot be included in a degree which contains DIT852."
