    "Confirmation": "This course syllabus was confirmed by The IT Faculty Board on 2011-12-02 to be valid from 2012-09-03.",
    "Position in the educational system": "The course is a part of the Computer Science Master's Programme and an elective\ncourse at the Univeristy of Gothenburg\nThe course can be part of the following programmes: 1) Computer Science, Master's\nProgramme (N2COS), 2) Computer Science, Bachelor's Programme (N1COS) and 3)\nNo translation available (NDATM)",
    "Entry requirements": "The requirement for the course is to have successfully completed two years within the\nsubject Computer Science or equivalent. The course DIT230 Programming languages\ntechnology or equivalent, is required.",
    "Learning outcomes": "After completion of the course the student is expected to be able to:\nKnowledge and understanding\nmake informed choices about the design and use of advanced programming\nlanguage technology.\nSkills and abilities\ncritically evaluate new programming languages and tools effectively assimilate and\nsummarise advanced research material,\ndeliver effective and clear presentations of highly technical programming language\nresearch.\nJudgement and approach\nidentify the frontiers of research in the area of programming languages.",
    "Course content": "The course runs throughout the whole academic year, with regular seminars and\ndiscussions, occasional exercises, and a finishing with presentations of project work.\nParticipants usually deliver several short presentations during the course, including\npresentations about programming languages, research papers from recent top\nconferences in programming language technology, and their own project work.",
    "Sub-courses": "",
    "Form of teaching": "Language of instruction: English",
    "Assessment": "The course is examined on basis of the project done in a group or individually and on\nthe individual performance in presentations, discussions and exercises.\nA student who has failed the same examination twice has the right to request of the\ndepartment a change of examiner. The request is to be in writing and submitted as soon\nas possible. The department is to grant such a request without delay.\nIn cases where a course has been discontinued or major changes have been made a\nstudent should be guaranteed at least three examination occasions (including the\nordinary examination occasion) during a time of at least one year from the last time the\ncourse was given.",
    "Grades": "The grading scale comprises: Fail (U), Pass (G), Pass with Distinction (VG).\nTo Pass the course the participant must have a good attendance record, and achieve a\nsatisfactory performance in the presentation and project components of the course. In\ndetermining whether a Pass with Distinction (VG) will be awarded around 50% of the\nfinal grade is determined by the project component, and 50% on the performance in the\nother presentations.",
    "Course evaluation": "The course is evaluated through meetings both during and after the course between\nteachers and student representatives. Further, an anonymous questionnaire is used to\nensure written information. The outcome of the evaluations serves to improve the\ncourse by indicating which parts could be added, improved, changed or removed.",
    "Additional information": "It is recommended but not required, to read DIT300 compiler construction beforehand."
