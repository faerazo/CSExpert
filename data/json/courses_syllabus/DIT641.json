    "Confirmation": "This course syllabus was confirmed by The IT Faculty Board on 2006-11-17 and was last revised on 2017-06-16 by Department of Computer Science and Engineering to be valid from 2017-08-20, autumn semester of 2017.",
    "Position in the educational system": "The course is a part of the Computer Science Master's Programme and a single subject course at University of Gothenburg.\n\nThe course can be part of the following programmes: 1) Computer Science, Master's Programme (N2COS), 2) Applied Data Science Master's Programme (N2ADS) and 3) Computer Science, Bachelor's Programme (N1COS)",
    "Entry requirements": "To be eligible for the course students should have successfully completed courses corresponding to 60 hec within the subject Computer Science or equivalent.\nA 7.5 hec course in Programming is required.\nApplicants must prove knowledge of English: English 6/English B or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.",
    "Learning outcomes": "After completing the course the student is expected to be able to:\n\nKnowledge and understanding\n• explain the fundamental goals of computer security,\n• describe several security vulnerabilities and possible protection mechanisms,\n• describe common methods for security assessment and evaluation as well as problems with current security metrication\n\nCompetence and skills\n• analyze the security of different types of systems and suggest improvements\n• use a few methods for security modeling\n• demonstrate his or her skill in technical writing\n\nJudgement and approach\n• assess the advantages and disadvantages between different protection mechanisms\n• judge the consequences of insecurity\n• Keep an informed argument of the ethical and social aspects of computer security",
    "Course content": "The course gives basic knowledge in the security area, i.e. how to protect your system against intrusions and attacks. The purpose of intrusions can be to change or delete resources (data, programs, hardware, etc), to get unauthorized access to confidential information or unauthorized use of the system's services. The course covers threats and vulnerabilities in the computer systems and networks, as well as rules, methods and mechanisms for protection. Modeling and assessment of security and dependability as well as metrication methods are covered. A holistic security approach is taken and organizational, business-related, social, human, legal and ethical aspects are treated. The following topics will be covered, among others.\n\n• Introduction to computer security\n• Overview of security threats\n• Introduction to cryptography.\n• Security in operating systems\n• Security mechanisms including authentication, authorization, and access control\n• Introduction to Network Security and Intrusion detection systems\n• Security Models: Bell-LaPadula, Biba, Chinese wall etc.\n• Security management, organization and ethics",
    "Sub-courses": "1. Examination (Tentamen), 6 higher education credits\nGrading scale: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U)\n2. Laboratory Experiment (Laboration), 1.5 higher education credits\nGrading scale: Pass (G) and Fail (U)",
    "Form of teaching": "The course consists of a series of lectures and exercises in a laboratory. Normally, one or two lectures are given by lecturers from industry, who give an application perspective on security. The exercises in the laboratory focus on a few common security mechanisms.",
    "Assessment": "The course is examined by laboratory exercises done in a group of normally two students and a written exam done individually in an examination hall.\n\nIf a student, who has failed the same examined component twice, wishes to change examiner before the next examination, a written application shall be sent to the department responsible for the course and shall be granted unless there are special reasons to the contrary (Chapter 6, Section 22 of Higher Education Ordinance).\n\nIn cases where a course has been discontinued or has undergone major changes, the student shall normally be guaranteed at least three examination occasions (including the ordinary examination) during a period of at least one year from the last time the course was given.",
    "Grades": "The grading scale comprises: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U).\nIn order to be awarded the grade Pass for the whole course, the student must pass the written exam and the laboratory experiment.\nIn order to be awarded the grade Pass with Distinction for the whole course, the student must get the grade Pass with distinction on the sub-course written exam and pass the sub- course laboratory experiment.",
    "Course evaluation": "The course is evaluated through meetings both during and after the course between teachers and student representatives. Further, an anonymous questionnaire is used to ensure written information. The outcome of the evaluations serves to improve the course by indicating which parts could be added, improved, changed or removed.",
    "Additional information": "The course is a joint course together with Chalmers."
