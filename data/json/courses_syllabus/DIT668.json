    "Confirmation": "This course syllabus was confirmed by Department of Computer Science and\nEngineering on 2013-11-11 to be valid from 2015-01-19.",
    "Position in the educational system": "The course is a part of the Computer Science Master's Programme and a single subject\ncourse at the University of Gothenburg.\nThe course can be part of the following programme: 1) Computer Science, Master's\nProgramme (N2COS)",
    "Entry requirements": "Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, or equivalent is required.\nThe student should have successfully completed the following courses (or equivalent):\nDIT791 Introduction to Computer Engineering, 7.5 hp, DIT600 Algorithms, 7.5 hp,\nDIT960 Data Structures, 7.5 hp, and at least 7.5 hp in programming.\nWe also expect 7.5hp or equivalent in one of the four areas: Computer Communication\n(such as DIT400 or equivalent), Operating Systems (such as DIT400 or equivalent),\nComputer Security (such as DIT641 or equivalent), or Distributed Systems (such as\nDIT240 or equivalent).\nEnglish B level or English proficiency equivalent to IELTS 6.5 no part under 5.5 or\nTOEFL 575 p, TWE score 4.5 is also required.",
    "Learning outcomes": "After completion of the course the student is expected to be able to:\n1. Knowledge and understanding:\n• demonstrate knowledge in the smart grid domain, in particular on ICT methods for\nsupporting adaptiveness and cybersecurity, including protocol or algorithms design,\nprogramming and evaluation, in order to meet the requirements of sustainable\ndevelopment in economic and ecological terms.\n• demonstrate knowledge of current research and development in the area of\nadaptiveness and cybersecurity smars grids.\n2. Skills and abilities:\n• design and analyse methods, algorithms, protocols for adaptive and cybersecure\nsmart power grid networks.\n• explain complex algorithms and concepts.\n• plan and organize a small team project and document the work and the result in a\nreport.\n3. Judgement and approach:\n•\npresent complex material to a small audience.\n• improve skills in running a small team project, practice technical writing.\n• judge the relevance of the Literature in a topic.",
    "Course content": "The course gives an introduction of the smart grid and its increased dependence on\ninformation and communication technologies (ICT).\nThe course is about methods that should aim at helping to adapt to the needs and\ncapacities of consumers, industry and society and meet the requirements of sustainable\ndevelopment in economic and ecological terms. Areas such as distributed computing\nand systems, information and systems security, networking and computer\ncommunication are important in this context.\nAs part of the course, the student is expected to complete lab work, i.e. a significant\nproject with relevance to the smart grid. In this way the student will also gain experience\nat the front connecting research and education in the main domain overlapping ICT and\nEnergy. To support the project work, the course is built around seminars where you\nlearn about the design or development of systems, infrastructure, and applications that\nare related to the electric power smart grid, with a focus on distributed algorithms and\nsecurity. The student is expected to give some presentations, as well as to participate\nactively in discussions.\nTopics:\n• Introduction to the smart grid\n• Organization of the envisioned grid, open problems\n• Terminology and electrical properties; devices in the smart grid such as the Smart\nMeter -- what is it and how does it work?\n• Data measurements, communication and computation technologies\n• Cybersecurity issues in the smart grid\n• Parallel and distributed algorithms for demand-response systems and data analysis.",
    "Sub-courses": "",
    "Form of teaching": "Language of instruction: English",
    "Assessment": "The course is examined by a written report on the project conducted by the student, and\noral presentation, including demonstration. The written report is normally carried out in\ngroups of 2-3 students.\nIn order to pass the course the student is expected to also participate actively in\nseminars, including presentations and discussion of new topics.\nA student who has failed two examinations on the same material has the right to request\na change of examiner. Such a request must be submitted to the Department in writing\nand shall be granted unless there are particular reasons not to do so.\nIn cases where a course has been discontinued or has undergone major changes, students\nmust be guaranteed at least three examination opportunities (including the regular\nopportunity) based on the previous content of the course for a period of at least one\nyear.",
    "Grades": "The grading scale comprises: Fail (U), Pass (G), Pass with Distinction (VG).\nIn order to get the grade Pass for the full course the student must have fulfilled the\nassessment requirements.\nIn order to get the grade Pass with Distinction for the whole course, the student must\nhave fulfilled the assessment requirements with excellent outcome.\nTo be awarded grade Pass (G), the student shall demonstrate multi structural knowledge\nby carrying out presentations and producing a report that is well structured and easy to\nread, that analyses a related problem using concepts defined by the course literature,\nthat properly cites the course literature, and whose content covers all learning outcomes.\nIn addition the student must also fulfill the other obligatory parts of the course.\nTo be awarded grade Pass with Honor (VG), the student shall demonstrate relational\nknowledge by carrying out presentations and producing a report that, in addition,\nincorporates relevant theories not covered by the course literature in the analysis and\nthat synthesizes findings from several theoretical perspectives to arrive at conclusions\nthat cannot be made from a single perspective alone. In addition the student must also\nfulfill the other obligatory parts of the course.",
    "Course evaluation": "The course is evaluated through meetings both during and after the course between\nteachers and student representatives. Further, an anonymous questionnaire is used to\nensure written information. The outcome of the evaluations serves to improve the\ncourse by indicating which parts could be added, improved, changed or removed.",
    "Additional information": "The course is a joint course together with Chalmers."
