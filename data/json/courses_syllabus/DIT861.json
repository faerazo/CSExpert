    "Confirmation": "This course syllabus was confirmed by Department of Computer Science and\nEngineering on 2017-01-05 to be valid from 2017-08-28, autumn semester of 2017.",
    "Position in the educational system": "The course is offered within the Applied Data Science Master's Programme, where it is\ncompulsory. The course is also a single subject course at the University of Gothenburg.\nThe course can be part of the following programme: 1) Applied Data Science Master's\nProgramme (N2ADS)",
    "Entry requirements": "To be eligible to the course, the student should have a Bachelor's degree in a subject\nrelevant to Data Science.\nIn addition, at least 7.5 credits of programming are required, as well as one of the\ncourses DIT851 Introduction to Data Science or DIT855 Applied Mathematical\nThinking, alternatively at least 7.5 credits of mathematics.\nApplicants must prove a knowledge of English: English 6/English B or the equivalent\nlevel of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.",
    "Learning outcomes": "On successful completion of the course the student will be able to:\nKnowledge and understanding\n• account for basic notions of probability theory and statistical theory, with an\nemphasis on applications and experiments in data science,\n• give examples of how probabilistic models are applied in data science applications.\nSkills and abilities\n• compute descriptive statistics and visualizations using statistical software libraries,\n• implement some probabilistic models and apply them in data science applications,\n• apply statistical tests for evaluating data science applications.\nJudgement and approach\n• justify which type of statistical method is applicable for the most common types of\nexperiments in data science applications,\n• discuss advantages and drawbacks of different types of probabilistic models that can\nbe applicable for a given data science application.",
    "Course content": "The course gives an introduction to the theory of probability and statistics, data analysis\nusing descriptive statistics and data visualization, and applications of probabilistic\nmodeling in data science.\nIn the course, the following broad areas will be covered:\n• data analysis including descriptive statistics and data visualization,\n• probability theory including basic probability calculations, random variables,\ndistributions,\n• statistical methods including point and interval estimates, hypothesis testing,\nbootstrapping,\n• probabilistic models in data science applications, for instance, Naive Bayes\nclassifiers and topic models for text or Hidden Markov Models for sequences.",
    "Sub-courses": "1. Written examination (Skriftlig tentamen), 4 higher education credits\nGrading scale: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U)\n2. Written assignments (Skriftliga inlämningsuppgifter), 3.5 higher education credits\nGrading scale: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U)",
    "Form of teaching": "Lectures, exercise sessions, computer lab sessions.\nLanguage of instruction: English",
    "Assessment": "The course is examined by an individual written exam carried out in an examination\nhall, as well as mandatory written assignments submitted as written reports, some of\nwhich will be carried out individually and others will be carried out in groups of\nnormally 2-4 students.\nIf a student who has failed the same examined component twice, wishes to change\nexaminer before the next examination, a written application shall be sent to the\ndepartment responsible for the course and shall be granted unless there are special\nreasons to the contrary (Chapter 6, Section 22 of Higher Education Ordinance).\nIn cases where a course has been discontinued or has undergone major changes, the\nstudent shall normally be guaranteed at least three examination occasions (including the\nordinary examination) during a period of at least one year from the last time the course\nwas given.",
    "Grades": "The grading scale comprises: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U).\nIn order to be awarded a Pass (G) for a full course, the grade G must be obtained on\nboth the sub-courses. To be awarded Pass with Distinction (VG) for the full course, the\ngrade VG must be obtained on both the sub-courses.",
    "Course evaluation": "The course is evaluated through meetings both during and after the course between\nteachers and student representatives. Further, an anonymous questionnaire is used to\nensure written information. The outcome of the evaluations serves to improve the\ncourse by indicating which parts could be added, improved, changed or removed.",
    "Additional information": "Course literature to be announced the latest 8 weeks prior to the start of the course."
