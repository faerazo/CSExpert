To be eligible to the course, the student must have a Bachelor's degree.

In particular, the student must have acquired the following knowledge:

- 15 credits of courses in programming or equivalent,
- a course including probability and statistics, such as DIT862 Statistical Methods for Data Science or MSG810 Mathematical Statistics and Discrete mathematics,

- a first course in machine learning, such as DIT866 Applied Machine Learning, DIT381 Algorithms for Machine Learning and Inference, or MSA220 Statistical Learning for Big Data

Applicants must prove knowledge of English: English 6/English B or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.

## Content

The purpose with this course is to give a thorough introduction to deep machine learning, also known as deep learning or deep neural networks. Over the last few years, deep machine learning has dramatically changed the state of the art performance in

various fields including speech-recognition, computer vision and reinforcement learning (used, e.g., to learn how to play Go). We focus primarily on basic principles regarding how these networks are constructed and trained, but we also cover many of the key

techniques used in different applications. The overall objective is to provide a solid understanding of how and why deep machine learning is useful, as well as the skills to apply them to solve problems of practical importance.

In the course, the following broad areas will be covered:

- supervised learning by cross-entropy minimisation and cross-validation
- back propagation and stochastic gradient descent
- a suitable programming language for implementing deep learning algorithm
- feedforward neural networks and convolutional neural networks
- recurrent neural networks and long short-term memory networks
- techniques for efficient training such as momentum and batch normalisation
- modern variations of neural networks (e.g., attention and residual networks)
- transfer learning and data augmentation
- reinforcement learning, Markov decision problems, q-learning and deep q-learning
- application of convolutional neural networks on image recognition and reinforcement learning

## Objectives

On successful completion of the course the student will be able to:

**_Knowledge and understanding_**

- explain the fundamental principles of supervised (and unsupervised) learning, including basic techniques like cross-validation to avoid overfitting
- describe the standard cost functions optimised during supervised training (in particular the cross entropy) and the standard solution techniques (stochastic gradient descent, back propagation, etc.)
- explain how traditional feed-forward networks are constructed and why they can approximate "almost" any function (the universality theorem)
- understand the problem with vanishing gradients and modern tools to mitigate it (e.g., batch normalisation and residual networks)
- summarise the key components in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their key advantages
- describe common types of recurrent neural networks (RNN) and their applications
- provide an overview of some of the many modern variations of the deep learning networks
- explain what a Markov decision problem and reinforcement learning (RL) are

**_Competence and skills_**

- make use of deep learning to solve RL using, e.g., deep q-learning
- train and apply CNNs to image applications and RNNs to applications related to time sequences such as those involved in R
- use a suitable deep learning library (e.g., TensorFlow or Torch) to solve a variety of practical applications

**_Judgement and approach_**

- argue for the benefits and limitations of generative models, transfer learning and data augmentation in situations when we have a limited amount of annotated/labelled data

## Sustainability labelling

No sustainability labelling.


## Form of teaching

The course comprises on-line lectures (to watch before the class), active learning sessions (where we review material from the corresponding lecture), assignments, a project and tutorial sessions.

## Examination formats

The students are evaluated individually based on their performance in the different activities in the course; more specifically, the grade is obtained by weighting the results on hand-ins, project and the degree of attendance.

If a student who has been failed twice for the same examination element wishes to change examiner before the next examination session, such a request is to be granted unless there are specific reasons to the contrary (Chapter 6 Section 22 HF).

If a student has received a certificate of disability study support from the University of Gothenburg with a recommendation of adapted examination and/or adapted forms of assessment, an examiner may decide, if this is consistent with the course’s intended learning outcomes and provided that no unreasonable resources would be needed, to grant the student adapted examination and/or adapted forms of assessment.

If a course has been discontinued or undergone major changes, the student must be offered at least two examination sessions in addition to ordinary examination sessions. These sessions are to be spread over a period of at least one year but no more than two years after the course has been discontinued/changed. The same applies to placement and internship (VFU) except that this is restricted to only one further examination session.

If a student has been notified that they fulfil the requirements for being a student at Riksidrottsuniversitetet (RIU student), to combine elite sports activities with studies, the examiner is entitled to decide on adaptation of examinations if this is done in accordance with the Local rules regarding RIU students at the University of Gothenburg.

## Grades

Sub-courses

1. Assignments, 4.5 credits


Grading scale: Pass with distinction (5), Pass with credit (4), Pass (3) and Fail (U)
2. Project, 3 credits


Grading scale: Pass with distinction (5), Pass with credit (4), Pass (3) and Fail (U)

The grading scale for the whole course comprises: Pass with distinction (5), Pass with credit (4), Pass (3) and Fail (U).

The course is examined by attendance at compulsory activities, by written assignments and a project, out of which some are carried out individually and some in groups of normally 2-4 students. Non-attendance at a limited number of compulsory activities can be tolerated, and will typically be examined through supplementary assignments.

## Course evaluation

If a student, who has failed the same examined element on two occasions, wishes to change examiner before the next examination session, such a request is to be submitted to the department in writing and granted unless there are special reasons to the contrary (Chapter 6, Section 22 of Higher Education Ordinance). In the event that a course has ceased or undergone major changes, students are to be guaranteed at least three examination sessions (including the ordinary examination session) over a period of at least one year, though at most two years after the course has ceased/been changed. The same applies to work experience and VFU, although this is restricted to just one additional examination session.

## Other regulations

The course is a joint course together with Chalmers.

The course replaces the course DIT968, 7.5 hec. The course cannot be included in a degree which contains DIT968. Neither can the course be included in a degree which is based on another degree in which the course DIT968 is included.
