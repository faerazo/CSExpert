## About

In this course you will study numerical techniques for approximating the solutions of linear systems of equations, least squares problems and eigenvalue problems. You will learn about relevant applications and about the mathematical background of these problems, and how the algorithms are constructed. By solving problems and doing computer exercises you will learn to apply current methods, study their resource use and judge how reliable the results are.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Knowledge equivalent to the courses MMG400 Linear Algebra II and MMG410 Numerical analysis.

### Selection

All eligible applicants who have applied before the deadline will be granted a place.

## Facilities

Mathematical Sciences is a joint department of Chalmers/University of Gothenburg. Your education takes place in the spacious and bright premises of Mathematical Sciences at the Chalmers campus Johanneberg, where there are lecture halls, computer rooms and group rooms. Here you can also find student lunch room and reading room, as well as student counsellors and student office.
