## About

The course gives an introduction to modelling various optimization problems using linear programming (LP) and integer linear programming (ILP). The Simplex algorithm to solve LPs is described and analysed. The LP relaxations of ILPs are studied and analysed to design approximation algorithms. The duality theory of linear programs is studied and used to design approximation algorithms. Vector programs to model discrete optimization problems are described and relaxed to semi-definite programs (SDPs).
