## About

The course aims to provide broad knowledge about algorithms for three dimensional computer graphics and also gives the student experience in implementing basic 3Dgraphic techniques.

The course provides knowledge of the principles used to create images through computer algorithms. The primary focus is on real-time rendering and photo realistic rendering.

The first part of the course covers real-time rendering, where techniques and data structures for e.g. illumination, special effects, shadows and reflections will be studied.

Design of graphics hardware and speedup algorithms will also be treated.

The second part focus on generating photo-realistic images and includes the studying of algorithms for ray tracing and global illumination.

Overall, the course provides explanations and some capabilities to, on a basic level, apply corresponding mathematics, e.g., object and camera transformations, light/material interaction, and intersection tests. For this, linear algebra is used.

The course contains some programming tutorials, giving the students practical skills concerning programming for 3D-graphics.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

To be eligible for the course, students should have successfully completed courses corresponding to 90 credits within the subject of Computer Science, including the following courses:

\- 7\\.5 credits in data structures (DIT960 or equivalent), and

\- 15 credits in imperative or object-oriented programing (DIT012 and DIT952, orequivalent).

Applicants must prove knowledge of English: English 6/English B or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 285 credits
