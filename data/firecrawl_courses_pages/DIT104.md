## About

This course introduces the basic design methodology in interaction design. The course consists of several smaller exercises, a group project, and an individual examination.

Theory is combined with practical training to give students practice in working systematically with the design of computational things and systems. Training in specific design methods is provided through exercises and the group project while meta methods such as iterative design and user centered design are aspects of the home exam.
