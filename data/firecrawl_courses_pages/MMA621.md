## About

Modern computers can make billions of calculations per second, but it is often difficult to attain these top speeds. An important part of the course is code optimization, where you will learn to write efficient programs in Fortran, C, and Matlab. For even higher performance you will learn to write parallell programs using OpenMP (threads) and MPI (process-based). The course also touches on Unix and computer hardware.

The focus is on numerical calculations, but you can also apply the methods to most programming problems.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Knowledge equivalent to 90 credits, including the courses MMG300 Multivariable Analysis and MMG410 Numerical Analysis, as well as a basic course in computer programming.

### Selection

All eligible applicants who have applied before the deadline will be granted a place.

## Facilities

Mathematical Sciences is a joint department of Chalmers/University of Gothenburg. Your education takes place in the spacious and bright premises of Mathematical Sciences at the Chalmers campus Johanneberg, where there are lecture halls, computer rooms and group rooms. Here you can also find student lunch room and reading room, as well as student counsellors and student office.
