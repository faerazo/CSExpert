## About

The aim of the course is to convey basic knowledge of models and methods with practical applications, mainly in Data Science for biomedicine. After completing the course you will be able to: perform data analysis for controlled randomized experiments such as hypothesis testing and survival analysis as well as calculation of sample size for hypothesis testing within randomized experiments, understand the framework for linear mixed models, perform statistical analysis of longitudinal data with SAS, identify hierarchical data structures and perform statistical analysis with R.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Knowledge corresponding to at least one of the courses DIT862 Statistical Methods for Data Science or MSG110 Probability Theory.

### Selection

All eligible applicants who have applied before the deadline will be granted a place.

## Facilities
