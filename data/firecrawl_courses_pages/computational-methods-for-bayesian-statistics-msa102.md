## About

The course gives an introduction to Bayesian statistical modelling and inference, focusing on computational methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and other simulation methods, but also looking at tools such the EM algorithm. We emphasize the interplay between statistical modelling and applied problem solving, as well as computational and theoretical aspects of the models.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Basic skills in mathematical statistics.

Basic skills in scientific programming (for example in Matlab or R) as achieved by completing MSG400 "Stochastic Data Processing and Simulation".

### Selection

All eligible applicants who have applied before the deadline will be granted a place.

## Facilities

Mathematical Sciences is a joint department of Chalmers/University of Gothenburg. Your education takes place in the spacious and bright premises of Mathematical Sciences at the Chalmers campus Johanneberg, where there are lecture halls, computer rooms and group rooms. Here you can also find student lunch room and reading room, as well as student counsellors and student office.
