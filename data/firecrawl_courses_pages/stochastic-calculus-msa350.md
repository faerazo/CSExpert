## About

Calculus, including integration, differentiation, and differential equations are insufficient to model stochastic phenomena like noise disturbances of signals in engineering, uncertainty about future stock prices in finance, and microscopic particle movement in natural sciences. This course gives a solid basic knowledge of stochastic analysis and stochastic differential equations. Brownian motion calculus. Elements of Levy processes and martingales. Stochastic integrals.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

An undergraduate course in mathematical statistics or a strong mathematical background.

### Selection

All eligible applicants who have applied before the deadline will be granted a place.

## Facilities

Mathematical Sciences is a joint department of Chalmers/University of Gothenburg. Your education takes place in the spacious and bright premises of Mathematical Sciences at the Chalmers campus Johanneberg, where there are lecture halls, computer rooms and group rooms. Here you can also find student lunch room and reading room, as well as student counsellors and student office.
